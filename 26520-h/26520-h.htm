<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>PETE&#8217;S GIRL</h3>
</div>

<p>She stood in the doorway, a patched and ragged Cinderella
of the desert. Upon her slim, ill-poised figure the
descending sun slanted a shaft of glory. It caught in a
spotlight the cheap, dingy gown, the coarse stockings
through the holes of which white flesh peeped, the heavy,
broken brogans that disfigured the feet. It beat upon a
small head with a mass of black, wild-flying hair, on red
lips curved with discontent, into dark eyes passionate
and resentful at what fate had made of her young life.
A silent, sullen lass, one might have guessed, and the
judgment would have been true as most first impressions.</p>
<p>The girl watched her father drive half a dozen dogies
into the mountain corral perched precariously on the
hillside. Soon now it would be dusk. She went back
into the cabin and began to prepare supper.</p>
<p>In the rickety stove she made a fire of cottonwood.
There was a business-like efficiency in the way she
peeled potatoes, prepared the venison for the frying-pan,
and mixed the biscuit dough.</p>
<p>June Tolliver and her father lived alone on Piceance<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Creek. Their nearest neighbor was a trapper on Eighteen-Mile
Hill. From one month&#8217;s end to another she did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
not see a woman. The still repression in the girl&#8217;s face
was due not wholly to loneliness. She lived on the edge
of a secret she intuitively felt was shameful. It colored
her thoughts and feelings, set her apart from the rest of
the world. Her physical reactions were dominated by
it. Yet what this secret was she could only guess at.</p>
<p>A knock sounded on the door.</p>
<p>June brushed back a rebellious lock of hair from her
eyes with the wrist above a flour-whitened hand.
&#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>A big dark man stood on the threshold. His glance
swept the girl, searched the room, and came back to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pete Tolliver live here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He&#8217;s lookin&#8217; after the stock. Be in soon,
likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man closed the door. June dragged a chair from
a corner and returned to her cooking.</p>
<p>From his seat the man watched her. His regard was
disturbing. It had a quality of insistence. His eyes were
cold yet devouring. They were possessive, not clear but
opaque. They did not look at her as other eyes did. She
felt the blood burning in her cheeks.</p>
<p>Presently, as she passed from the table to the stove to
look at the sputtering venison, she flashed a resentful
glance at him. It did not touch his effrontery.</p>
<p>&#8220;You Pete&#8217;s girl?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve grown. Knew you when you was learnin&#8217; to
crawl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Brown&#8217;s Park?&#8221; The words were out before she
could stop them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You done said it.&#8221; He smiled, not pleasantly, she
thought. &#8220;I&#8217;m a real old friend of yore father.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curiosity touched with apprehension began to stir in
her. For those early years she had only memory to rely
upon. Tolliver never referred to them. On that subject
the barriers were up between the two. Fugitive flashes
of that first home came back to June. She remembered
a sweet, dark-eyed woman nuzzling her little body with
kisses after the bath, an hour when that mother wept as
though her heart would break and she had put little
baby arms in tight embrace round her neck by way of
comfort. That dear woman was not in any of the later
pictures. A pile of stones on a hillside in Brown&#8217;s Park
marked the grave.</p>
<p>Between the day of &#8217;Lindy Tolliver&#8217;s outburst of
grief and the child&#8217;s next recollection was a gap. The
setting of the succeeding memories was a frame house
on a dusty road at the edge of a frontier town. In front
of it jolted big freight wagons, three of them fastened
together and drawn by a double row of oxen so long she
could not count them. The place was Rawlins, Wyoming,
and it was an outfitting point for a back country
in Colorado hundreds of miles from the railroad. The
chief figure in June&#8217;s horizon was a stern-eyed, angular
aunt who took the place of both father and mother and
did her duty implacably. The two lived together forever,
it seemed to the child.</p>
<p>June wakened one night from the light of a lamp in
her aunt&#8217;s hand. A man was standing beside her. He
was gaunt and pallid, in his eyes a look of hunger that
reminded her of a hunted coyote. When he took her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
tightly in his arms she began to cry. He had murmured,
&#8220;My li&#8217;l&#8217; baby, don&#8217;t you be scared of yore paw.&#8221; As
mysteriously as he had come to life, so Pete Tolliver
disappeared again.</p>
<p>Afterward there was a journey with a freight outfit
which lasted days and days. June was in charge of a
bullwhacker. All she remembered about him was that
he had been kind to her and had expended a crackling
vocabulary on his oxen. The end of the trek brought her
to Piceance Creek and a father now heavily bearded
and with long, unkempt hair. They had lived here
ever since.</p>
<p>Did this big man by the window belong to her father&#8217;s
covered past? Was there menace in his coming? Vaguely
June felt that there was.</p>
<p>The door opened and Tolliver stepped in. He was
rather under middle-size, dressed in down-at-the-heel
boots, butternut jeans, cotton shirt, and dusty, ragged
slouch hat. The grizzled beard hid the weak mouth, but
the skim-milk eyes, the expression of the small-featured
face, betrayed the man&#8217;s lack of force. You may meet
ten thousand like him west of the Mississippi. He lives
in every village, up every creek, in every valley, and
always he is the cat&#8217;s-paw of stronger men who use him
for good or ill to serve their ends.</p>
<p>The nester stopped in his tracks. It was impossible
for June to miss the dismay that found outlet in the
fallen jaw and startled eyes.</p>
<p>In the stranger&#8217;s grin was triumphant malice. &#8220;You
sure look glad to see me, Pete, and us such old friends
too. Le&#8217;s see, I ain&#8217;t seen you since&mdash;since&mdash;&#8221; He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
stopped, as though his memory were at fault, but June
sensed the hint of a threat in the uncompleted sentence.</p>
<p>Reluctantly Tolliver took the offered hand. His consternation
seemed to have stricken him dumb.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you going to introduce yore old pal to the
girl?&#8221; the big man asked.</p>
<p>Not willingly, the rancher found the necessary words.
&#8220;June, meet Mr. Houck.&#8221;</p>
<p>June was putting the biscuits in the oven. She nodded
an acknowledgment of the introduction. Back of the
resentful eyes the girl&#8217;s brain was busy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old side pardners, ain&#8217;t we, Pete?&#8221; Houck was
jeering at him almost openly.</p>
<p>The older man mumbled what might be taken for an
assent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Branded a heap of cattle, you &#8217;n&#8217; me. Eh, Pete?&#8221;
The stranger settled deeper in the chair. &#8220;Jake Houck
an&#8217; you could talk over old times all night. We was
frolicsome colts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tolliver felt his hand forced. &#8220;Put off yore hat and
wash up, Jake. You&#8217;ll stay to-night, o&#8217; course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind if I do. I&#8217;m headed for Glenwood.
Reckon I&#8217;d better put the horse up first.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men left the cabin. When they returned half
an hour later, the supper was on the table. June sat on
the side nearest the stove and supplied the needs of the
men. Coffee, hot biscuits, more venison, a second dish
of gravy: no trained waiter could have anticipated their
wants any better. If she was a bit sulky, she had reason
for it. Houck&#8217;s gaze followed her like a searchlight. It
noted the dark good looks of her tousled head, the slimness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
of the figure which moved so awkwardly, a certain
flash of spirit in the undisciplined young face.</p>
<p>&#8220;How old&#8217;s yore girl?&#8221; the man asked his host.</p>
<p>Tolliver hesitated, trying to remember. &#8220;How old
are you, June?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going on sixteen,&#8221; she answered, eyes smouldering
angrily.</p>
<p>This man&#8217;s cool, impudent appraisal of her was hateful,
she felt.</p>
<p>He laughed at her manner, easily, insolently, for he
was of the type that finds pleasure in the umbrage of
women annoyed by his effrontery. Of the three the
guest was the only one quite at his ease. Tolliver&#8217;s ingratiating
jokes and the heartiness of his voice rang
false. He was troubled, uncertain how to face the situation
that had arisen.</p>
<p>His daughter reflected this constraint. Why did her
father fear this big dominating fellow? What was the
relation between them? Why did his very presence
bring with it a message of alarm?</p>
<p>She left them before the stove as soon as the dishes
were washed, retiring to the bedroom at the other end
of the log cabin. Far into the night she heard them talking,
in low voices that made an indistinct murmur. To
the sound of them she fell asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>&#8220;A SPUNKY LI&#8217;L&#8217; DEVIL&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Houck rode away next morning after breakfast, but not
before he had made a promise June construed as a
threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be back soon, girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes were on the corral, from which her father
was driving the dogies. &#8220;What&#8217;s it to me?&#8221; she said
with sullen resentment.</p>
<p>&#8220;More&#8217;n you think. I&#8217;ve took a fancy to you. When
I come back I&#8217;ll talk business.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes did not turn toward him, but the color
flooded the dark cheeks. &#8220;With Father maybe. Not
with me. You&#8217;ve got no business to talk over with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think so? Different here. Take a good look at me,
June Tolliver.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; Her glance traveled over him disdainfully
to the hound puppy chasing its tail. She felt a
strange excitement drumming in her veins. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen
folks a heap better worth lookin&#8217; at.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; you to.&#8221; His big hand caught
her chin and swung it back. &#8220;Because I&#8217;m figurin&#8217; on
marryin&#8217; you right soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her dark eyes blazed. They looked at him straight
enough now. &#8220;Take yore hand off&#8217;n me. D&#8217;you hear?&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed, slowly, delightedly. &#8220;You&#8217;re a spunky
li&#8217;l&#8217; devil. Suits me fine. Jake Houck never did like jog-trotters
in harness.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lemme go,&#8221; she ordered, and a small brown fist
clenched.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now, nor ever. You&#8217;re due to wear the Houck
brand, girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>She struck, hard, with all the strength of her lithe
and supple body. Above his cheek-bone a red streak
leaped out where the sharp knuckles had crushed the
flesh.</p>
<p>A second time he laughed, harshly. Her chin was still
clamped in a vice-like grip that hurt. &#8220;I get a kiss for
that, you vixen.&#8221; With a sweeping gesture he imprisoned
both of the girl&#8217;s arms and drew the slim body to
him. He kissed her, full on the lips, not once but half a
dozen times, while she fought like a fury without the
least avail.</p>
<p>Presently the man released her hands and chin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hit me again if you like, and I&#8217;ll c&#8217;lect my pay
prompt,&#8221; he jeered.</p>
<p>She was in a passionate flame of impotent anger. He
had insulted her, trampled down the pride of her untamed
youth, brushed away the bloom of her maiden
modesty. And there was nothing she could do to make
him pay. He was too insensitive to be reached by words,
no matter how she pelted them at him.</p>
<p>A sob welled up from her heart. She turned and ran
into the house.</p>
<p>Houck grinned, swung to the saddle, and rode up the
valley. June would hate him good and plenty, he
thought. That was all right. He had her in the hollow
of his hand. All her thoughts would be full of him. After
she quit struggling to escape she would come snuggling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
up to him with a girl&#8217;s shy blandishments. It was his
boast that he knew all about women and their ways.</p>
<p>June was not given to tears. There was in her the
stark pioneer blood that wrested the West in two generations
from unfriendly nature. But the young virgin
soul had been outraged. She lay on the bed of her room,
face down, the nails of her fingers biting into the palms
of the hands, a lump in the full brown throat choking
her.</p>
<p>She was a wild, free thing of the hills, undisciplined by
life. Back of June&#8217;s anger and offended pride lurked
dread, as yet indefinite and formless. Who was this
stranger who had swaggered into her life and announced
himself its lord and master? She would show him his
place, would teach him how ridiculous his pretensions
were. But even as she clenched her teeth on that promise
there rose before her a picture of the fellow&#8217;s straddling
stride, of the fleering face with its intrepid eyes
and jutting, square-cut jaw. He was stronger than she.
No scruples would hold him back from the possession of
his desires. She knew she would fight savagely, but a
chill premonition of failure drenched the girl&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p>Later, she went out to the stable where Tolliver was
riveting a broken tug. It was characteristic of the man
that all his tools, harness, and machinery were worn out
or fractured. He never brought a plough in out of the
winter storms or mended a leak in the roof until the need
was insistent. Yet he was not lazy. He merely did not
know how to order affairs with any system.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is that man?&#8221; June demanded.</p>
<p>He looked up, mildly surprised and disturbed at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
imperative in the girl&#8217;s voice. &#8220;Why, didn&#8217;t I tell you,
honey&mdash;Jake Houck?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to know his name. I want to know who
he is&mdash;all about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tolliver drove home a rivet before he answered.
&#8220;Jake&#8217;s a cowman.&#8221; His voice was apologetic. &#8220;I seen
you didn&#8217;t like him. He&#8217;s biggity, Jake is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the most hateful man I ever saw,&#8221; she burst
out.</p>
<p>Pete lifted thin, straw-colored eyebrows in questioning,
but June had no intention of telling what had taken
place. She would fight her own battles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s a sure enough toughfoot,&#8221; admitted the
rancher.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you know him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We was ridin&#8217; together, a right long time ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Up around Rawlins&mdash;thataway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said he knew you in Brown&#8217;s Park.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man flashed a quick, uncertain look at his daughter.
It appeared to ask how much Houck had told. &#8220;I
might &#8217;a&#8217; knowed him there too. Come to think of it, I
did. Punchers drift around a heap. Say, how about dinner?
You got it started? I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; powerful hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>June knew the subject was closed. She might have
pushed deeper into her father&#8217;s reticence, but some instinct
shrank from what she might uncover. There
could be only pain in learning the secret he so carefully
hid.</p>
<p>There had been no discussion of it between them, nor
had it been necessary to have any. It was tacitly understood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
that they would have little traffic with their neighbors,
that only at rare intervals would Pete drive to
Meeker, Glenwood Springs, or Bear Cat to dispose of
furs he had trapped and to buy supplies. The girl&#8217;s
thoughts and emotions were the product largely of this
isolation. She brooded over the mystery of her father&#8217;s
past till it became an obsession in her life. To be brought
into close contact with dishonor makes one either unduly
sensitive or callously indifferent. Upon June it had
the former effect.</p>
<p>The sense of inferiority was branded upon her. She
had seen girls giggling at the shapeless sacks she had
stitched together for clothes with which to dress herself.
She was uncouth, awkward, a thin black thing ugly as
sin. It had never dawned on her that she possessed rare
potentialities of beauty, that there was coming a time
when she would bloom gloriously as a cactus in a sand
waste.</p>
<p>After dinner June went down to the creek and followed
a path along its edge. She started up a buck lying
in the grass and watched it go crashing through the
brush. It was a big-game country. The settlers lived
largely on venison during the fall and winter. She had
killed dozens of blacktail, an elk or two, and more than
once a bear. With a rifle she was a crack shot.</p>
<p>But to-day she was not hunting. She moved steadily
along the winding creek till she came to a bend in its
course. Beyond this a fishing-rod lay in the path. On a
flat rock near it a boy was stretched, face up, looking
into the blue, unflecked sky.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>PALS</h3>
</div>

<p>He was a red-headed, stringy boy between eighteen and
nineteen years old. His hands were laced back of the
head, but he waggled a foot by way of greeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Lo, June,&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you doin&#8217;?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, jes&#8217; watchin&#8217; the grass grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat down beside him, drawing up her feet beneath
the skirt and gathering the knees between laced fingers.
Moodily, she looked down at the water swirling round
the rocks.</p>
<p>Bob Dillon said nothing. He had a capacity for silence
that was not uncompanionable. They could sit by
the hour, these two, quite content, without exchanging
a dozen sentences. The odd thing about it was that they
were not old friends. Three weeks ago they had met for
the first time. He was flunkeying for a telephone outfit
building a line to Bear Cat.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man stayed up to the house last night,&#8221; she said
at last.</p>
<p>He leaned his head on a hand, turning toward her.
The light blue eyes in the freckled face rested on those
of the girl.</p>
<p>Presently she added, with a flare of surging anger, &#8220;I
hate him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>The blood burned beneath the tan of the brown
cheeks. &#8220;&#8217;Cause.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks! That don&#8217;t do any good. It don&#8217;t buy you
anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>She swung upon him abruptly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you hate the
men at the camp when they knock you around?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d be the use? I duck outa the way next time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two savage little demons glared at him out of her
dark eyes. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t you got any sand in yore craw, Bob
Dillon? Do you aim to let folks run on you all yore life?
I&#8217;d fight &#8217;em if &#8217;t was the last thing I ever did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Different here. I&#8217;d get my block knocked off about
twice a week. You don&#8217;t see me in any scraps where I
ain&#8217;t got a look-in. I&#8217;d rather let &#8217;em boot me a few,&#8221;
he said philosophically.</p>
<p>She frowned at him, in a kind of puzzled wonderment.
&#8220;You&#8217;re right queer. If I was a man&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The sentence died out. She was not a man. The limitations
of sex encompassed her. In Jake Houck&#8217;s arms
she had been no more than an infant. He would crush
her resistance&mdash;no matter whether it was physical or
mental&mdash;and fling out at her the cruel jeering laughter
of one who could win without even exerting his strength.
She would never marry him&mdash;never, never in the world.
But&mdash;</p>
<p>A chill dread drenched her heart.</p>
<p>Young Dillon was sensitive to impressions. His eyes,
fixed on the girl&#8217;s face, read something of her fears.</p>
<p>&#8220;This man&mdash;who is he?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jake Houck. I never saw him till last night. My
father knew him when&mdash;when he was young.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with this Houck? Why don&#8217;t
you like him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d see him&mdash;how he looks at me.&#8221; She
flashed to anger. &#8220;As if I was something he owned and
meant to tame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, you know the old sayin&#8217;, a cat may look at
a king. He can&#8217;t harm you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t he? How do you know he can&#8217;t?&#8221; she challenged.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can he, come to that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t say he can.&#8221; Looked at in cold blood, through
the eyes of another, the near-panic that had seized her
a few hours earlier appeared ridiculous. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t
have to like him, do I? He acted&mdash;hateful&mdash;if you
want to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How d&#8217;you mean&mdash;hateful?&#8221;</p>
<p>A wave of color swept through her cheeks to the
brown throat. How could she tell him that there was
something in the man&#8217;s look that had disrobed her,
something in his ribald laugh that had made her feel
unclean? Or that the fellow had brushed aside the pride
and dignity that fenced her and ravished kisses from
her lips while he mocked? She could not have put her
feeling into words if she had tried, and she had no intention
of trying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mean,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A low-down, mean bully.&#8221;</p>
<p>The freckled boy watched her with a curious interest.
She made no more sex appeal to him than he did to her,
and that was none at all. The first thing that had moved
him in the child was the friendlessness back of her spitfire
offense. She knew no women, no other girls. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
conditions of life kept her aloof from the ones she met
casually once or twice a year. She suspected their laughter,
their whispers about the wild girl on Piceance Creek.
The pride with which she ignored them was stimulated
by her sense of inferiority. June had read books. She
felt the clothes she made were hideous, the conditions of
her existence squalid; and back of these externals was
the shame she knew because they must hide themselves
from the world on account of the secret.</p>
<p>Bob did not know all that, but he guessed some of it.
He had not gone very far in experience himself, but he
suspected that this wild creature of the hills was likely
to have a turbulent and perhaps tragic time of it. She
was very much a child of impulse. Thirstily she had
drunk in all he could tell her of the world beyond the
hills that hemmed them in. He had known her frank,
grateful, dreamy, shy, defiant, and once, for no apparent
reason, a flaming little fury who had rushed to eager
repentance when she discovered no offense was meant.
He had seen her face bubbling with mirth at the antics
of a chipmunk, had looked into the dark eyes when they
were like hill fires blazing through mist because of the
sunset light in the crotch of the range.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon Mr. Tolliver won&#8217;t let this Houck bully
<i>you</i> none,&#8221; the boy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t scared of him,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>But June knew there would be small comfort for her
in the thought of her father&#8217;s protection. She divined
intuitively that he would be a liability rather than an
asset in any conflict that might arise between her and
Jake Houck.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If there was anything I could do&mdash;but o&#8217; course
there ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she agreed. &#8220;Oh, well, I&#8217;m not worryin&#8217;. I&#8217;ll
show him when he comes back. I&#8217;m as big as he is behind
a gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob looked at her, startled. He saw she was whistling
to keep up her courage. &#8220;Are you sure enough afraid
of him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes met his. She nodded. &#8220;He said he was
coming back to marry me&mdash;good as said I could like it
or lump it, he didn&#8217;t care which.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! Tha&#8217;s jus&#8217; talk. No girl has to marry a man
if she don&#8217;t want to. You don&#8217;t need any gun-play. He
can&#8217;t make his brags good if you won&#8217;t have him. It&#8217;s a
free country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he told you to do something&mdash;this Jake Houck&mdash;you
wouldn&#8217;t think it was so free,&#8221; the girl retorted
without any life in her voice.</p>
<p>He jumped up, laughing. &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t expect he&#8217;s
liable to tell me to do anything. He ain&#8217;t ever met up
with me. I gotta go peel the spuds for supper. Don&#8217;t
you worry, June. He&#8217;s bluffin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon,&#8221; she said, and nodded a careless good-bye.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>CLIPPED WINGS</h3>
</div>

<p>The Cinderella of Piceance Creek was scrupulously
clean even though ragged and unkempt. Every Saturday
night she shooed Pete Tolliver out of the house and
took a bath in the tub which usually hung suspended
from a wooden peg driven into the outer wall of the log
cabin. Regularly as Monday came wash day.</p>
<p>On a windy autumn day, with the golden flames of
fall burning the foliage of the hill woods, June built a
fire of cottonwood branches near the brook and plunged
with fierce energy into the week&#8217;s washing. She was
a strong, lithe young thing and worked rapidly. Her
methods might not be the latest or the best, but they
won results. Before the sun had climbed halfway to its
zenith she had the clothes on the line.</p>
<p>Since she had good soapy suds and plenty of hot
water left in the iron kettle, June decided to scrub the
bed covers. Twenty minutes later, barefooted and
barelegged, her skirts tucked up above the knees, the
young washwoman was trampling blankets in the tub.
She had no reason to suppose that anybody was within
a mile of her. Wherefore, since the world was beautiful
and mere life a joy, she improvised a child&#8217;s song of
thanksgiving.</p>
<p>It was a foolish little thing without rhyme or reason.
It began nowhere and finished at the same place. But it
lifted straight from the heart and perhaps it traveled as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
far heavenward as most prayers. She danced among the
suds as she sang it, brown arms, bare to the elbows,
stretched to the sunlit hills.</p>

<p>It was an unschooled, impulsive cry of the heart to
the great soul of life and beauty that lies back of nature.
No human eyes or ears were meant to see or hear the
outburst. A shy girl&#8217;s first day-dreams of her lover
ought no more to be dragged out to the public gaze than
this.</p>
<p>Through the quaking asps by the creek narrowed
eyes gloated. Out of the thicket Jake Houck strode
with a ribald laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right pretty, my dear, but don&#8217;t you spread them
wings an&#8217; leave yore man alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dancing spirit fled her flying feet. She was no
longer a daughter of the skies, attuned to sunshine and
laughter and the golden harmony of the hills. Joy and
life were stricken out of her.</p>
<p>He had heard. He had seen. A poignant shame enveloped
and scorched the girl&#8217;s body. She was a wild
thing who lived within herself. It was easy to put her
in the wrong. She felt the mortification of one who has
been caught in some indecent exhibition.</p>
<p>The humiliation was at first for the song and dance.
Not till another moment did she think of the bare legs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
rising out of the soapsuds. His smouldering gaze brought
them to mind.</p>
<p>Instantly she leaped from the tub, shook down the
skirts, snatched up shoes and stockings, and fled barefooted
to the house. A brogan dropped a few steps from
the start. She stopped, as though to pick it up. But
Houck was following. The girl turned and ran like a
deer.</p>
<p>Houck retrieved the brogan and followed slowly. He
smiled. His close-set eyes were gleaming. This was an
adventure just to his taste.</p>
<p>The door of the cabin was bolted. He knocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s yore shoe, sweetheart,&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>No answer came. He tried the back door. It, too, had
the bolt driven home.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. If it ain&#8217;t yore shoe I&#8217;ll take it along with
me. So long.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked away and waited in the bushes. His expectation
was that this might draw her from cover. It
did not.</p>
<p>Half an hour later Tolliver rode across the mesa. He
found Houck waiting for him at the entrance to the
corral. Pete nodded a rather surly greeting. He could
not afford to quarrel with the man, but he was one of
the last persons in the world he wanted to see.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Lo, Jake,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Back again, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep. Finished my business. I got to have a talk
with you, Pete.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tolliver slid a troubled gaze at him. What did Jake
want? Was it money&mdash;hush money? The trapper did
not have fifty dollars to his name, nor for that matter
twenty.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;S all right, Jake. If there&#8217;s anything I can do for
you&mdash;why, all you got to do&#8217;s to let me know,&#8221; he said
uneasily.</p>
<p>Houck laughed, derisively. &#8220;Sure. I know how fond
you are of me, Pete. You&#8217;re plumb glad to see me again,
ain&#8217;t you? Jes&#8217; a-honin&#8217; to talk over old times, I&#8217;ll bet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d as lief forget them days, Jake,&#8221; Tolliver confessed.
&#8220;I done turned over another chapter, as you
might say. No need rakin&#8217; them up, looks like.&#8221;</p>
<p>The big man&#8217;s grin mocked him. &#8220;Tha&#8217;s up to you,
Pete. Me, I aim to be reasonable. I ain&#8217;t throwin&#8217; off on
my friends. All I want&#8217;s to make sure they <i>are</i> my
friends. Pete, I&#8217;ve took a fancy to yore June. I reckon
I&#8217;ll fix it up an&#8217; marry her.&#8221;</p>
<p>His cold eyes bored into Tolliver. They held the
man&#8217;s startled, wavering gaze fixed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Jake, you&#8217;re old enough to be her father,&#8221; he
presently faltered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I am. But if there&#8217;s a better man anywheres
about I&#8217;d like to meet up with him an&#8217; have him show
me. I ain&#8217;t but forty-two, Pete, an&#8217; I can whip my
weight in wild cats.&#8221;</p>
<p>The father&#8217;s heart sank. He knew Houck. The man
would get by hook or crook what he wanted. He could
even foretell what his next move would be.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s only a kid, Jake, not thinkin&#8217; none about gettin&#8217;
married. In a year or two, maybe&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m talkin&#8217; about now, Pete&mdash;this week.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tolliver wriggled, like a trout on the hook. &#8220;What
does she say? You spoke of it to her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. She&#8217;ll like it fine when she gets her mind used
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
to it. I know how to handle women, Pete. I&#8217;m mentionin&#8217;
this to you because I want you to use yore influence.
See?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pete saw, too well. He moistened his lips with the tip
of the tongue. &#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t reckon I could very well
do that. A girl&#8217;s got to make up her own mind. She&#8217;s
too young to be figurin&#8217; on marryin&#8217;. Better give her
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Houck flung the word out like an oath. &#8220;Now.
Right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trapper&#8217;s voice took on a plaintive note, almost a
whine. &#8220;You was sayin&#8217; yoreself, Jake, that she&#8217;d have
to get used to it. Looks like it wouldn&#8217;t be good to
rush&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She can get used to it after we&#8217;re married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O&#8217; course I want to do what&#8217;s right by my li&#8217;l&#8217; June.
You do too for that matter. We wouldn&#8217;t either one of
us do her a meanness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to marry her,&#8221; Houck insisted harshly.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a girl loses her mother she&#8217;s sure lost her best
friend. It&#8217;s up to her paw to see she gets a square deal.&#8221;
There was a quaver of emotion in Tolliver&#8217;s voice. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t reckon he can make up to her&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A sound came from Houck&#8217;s throat like a snarl. &#8220;Are
you tryin&#8217; to tell me that Pete Tolliver&#8217;s girl is too good
for me? Is that where you&#8217;re driftin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t you get mad, Jake,&#8221; the older man
pleaded. &#8220;These here are different times. I don&#8217;t want
my June mixed up with&mdash;with them Brown&#8217;s Park
days an&#8217; all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217; me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re twistin&#8217; my words, Jake,&#8221; the father went
on, an anxious desire to propitiate frowning out of the
wrinkled face. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t sayin&#8217; a word against you. I&#8217;m
explainin&#8217; howcome I to feel like I do. Since I&mdash;bumped
into that accident in the Park&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Houck&#8217;s ill-natured laugh cut the sentence. It was a
jangled dissonance without mirth. &#8220;What accident?&#8221;
he jeered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;when I got into the trouble&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean when Jas Stuart caught you rustlin&#8217; an&#8217;
you murdered him an&#8217; went to the pen. That what you
mean?&#8221; he demanded loudly.</p>
<p>Tolliver caught his sleeve. &#8220;S-sh! She don&#8217;t know a
thing about it. You recollect I told you that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other nodded, hard eyes gloating over the rancher&#8217;s
distress. &#8220;An&#8217; o&#8217; course she don&#8217;t know you broke
jail at Cañon City an&#8217; are liable to be dragged back if
any one should happen to whisper to the sheriff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a thing about all that. I wouldn&#8217;t holler it out
thataway if I was you, Jake,&#8221; Tolliver suggested, glancing
nervously toward the house. &#8220;Maybe I ought to
&#8217;a&#8217; told her, but I never did. Her maw died of it, an&#8217; I
jes&#8217; couldn&#8217;t make out to tell June. You see yoreself
how it would be, Pete. Her a li&#8217;l&#8217; trick with nobody
but me. I ain&#8217;t no great shakes, but at that I&#8217;m all she&#8217;s
got. I figured that &#8217;way off here, under another name,
they prob&#8217;ly never would find me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty good guess, Pete Purdy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217; call me that,&#8221; begged Tolliver.</p>
<p>Houck showed his teeth in an evil grin. &#8220;I forgot.
What I was sayin&#8217; was that nobody knows you&#8217;re here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
but me. Most folks have forgot all about you. You can
fix things so &#8217;s to be safe enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t give me away, Jake. You was in on
the rustlin&#8217; too. We was pals. It was jes&#8217; my bad luck I
met up with Jas that day. I didn&#8217;t begin the shooting.
You know that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t likely to give away my own father-in-law,
am I?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the close-set, hard eyes clamped fast to the
wavering ones of the tortured outlaw. In them Tolliver
read an ultimatum. Notice was being served on him
that there was only one way to seal Houck&#8217;s lips.</p>
<p>That way he did not want to follow. Pete was a weak
father, an ineffective one, wholly unable to give expression
to the feeling that at times welled up in him. But
June was all his life now held. He suffered because of
the loneliness their circumstances forced upon her. The
best was what he craved for her.</p>
<p>And Jake Houck was a long way from the best. He
had followed rough and evil trails all his life. As a boy,
in his cowpuncher days, he had been hard and callous.
Time had not improved him.</p>
<p>June came to the door of the cabin and called.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, honey?&#8221; Tolliver asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got my shoe. I want it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pete looked at the brogan sticking out of Jake&#8217;s
pocket. The big fellow forestalled a question.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take it to her,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Houck strode to the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s yore shoe after all,&#8221; he grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it here,&#8221; June demanded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say pretty please.&#8221;</p>
<p>She flashed to anger. &#8220;You&#8217;re the meanest man I
ever did meet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you&#8217;re the prettiest barelegged dancer on the
Creek,&#8221; he countered.</p>
<p>June stamped the one shoe she was wearing. &#8220;Are
you going to give me that brogan or not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll let me put it on for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Furious, she flung round and went back into the
house.</p>
<p>He laughed delightedly, then tossed the heavy shoe
into the room after her. &#8220;Here&#8217;s yore shoe, girl. I was
only foolin&#8217;,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>June snatched up the brogan, stooped, and fastened
it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>JUNE ASKS QUESTIONS</h3>
</div>

<p>Houck, an unwelcome guest, stayed at the cabin on
Piceance nearly two weeks. His wooing was surely one
of the strangest known. He fleered at June, taunted her,
rode over the girl&#8217;s pride and sense of decorum, beat
down the defenses she set up, and filled her bosom with
apprehension. It was impossible to score an advantage
over his stolid strength and pachydermous insensibility.</p>
<p>The trapper sweated blood. He neither liked nor
trusted his guest, but he was bound hand and foot. He
must sit and watch the fellow moving to his end, see the
gains he made day by day, and offer no effective protest.
For Houck at a word could send him back to the penitentiary
and leave June alone in a world to which her
life had been alien.</p>
<p>Pete knew that the cowman was winning the campaign.
His assumption that he was an accepted suitor of
June began to find its basis of fact. The truth could be
read in the child&#8217;s hunted eyes. She was still fighting,
but the battle was a losing one.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was the best way out of a bad situation,
Tolliver found himself thinking. In his rough way
Houck was fond of June. A blind man could see that.
Even though he was a wolf, there were moments when
his eyes were tender for her. He would provide well for
a wife. If his little Cinderella could bring herself to like
the man, there was always a chance that love would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
follow. Jake always had the knack of fascinating
women. He could be very attractive when he wished.</p>
<p>On a happy morning not long since June had sung of
her wings. She was a meadow-lark swooping over the
hills to freedom, her throat throbbing with songs of joy.
Sometimes Pete, too, thought of her as a bird, but
through many hours of anguished brooding he had come
to know she was a fledgling with broken wings. The
penalty for the father&#8217;s sins had fallen upon the child.
All her life she must be hampered by the environment
his wrongdoing had built up around them.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the world masterful men have
drawn to them the eyes and thoughts of women. June
was no exception. Among the hours when she hated
Houck were increasing moments during which a naïve
wonder and admiration filled her mind. She was primitive,
elemental. A little tingle of delight thrilled her to
know that this strong man wanted her and would fight
to win what his heart craved. After all he was her first
lover. A queer shame distressed the girl at the memory
of his kisses, for through all the anger, chagrin, and
wounded pride had come to her the first direct realization
of what sex meant. Her alarmed innocence pushed
this from her.</p>
<p>Without scruple Houck used all the weapons at hand.
There came a day when he skirted the edges of the secret.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;What is it
you claim to know about Dad all so big?&#8221;</p>
<p>He could see that June&#8217;s eyes were not so bold as the
words. They winced from his even as she put the question.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ask him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll I ask? I wouldn&#8217;t believe anything you
told me about him. He&#8217;s not like you. He&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to believe me. Ask him if he ever
knew any one called Pete Purdy. Ask him who Jasper
Stuart was. An&#8217; where he lived whilst you was stayin&#8217;
with yore aunt at Rawlins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t afraid to,&#8221; she retorted. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it right
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Houck was sprawled on a bench in front of the cabin.
He grinned impudently. His manner was an exasperating
challenge. Evidently he did not believe she would.</p>
<p>June turned and walked to the stable. The heavy
brogans weighted down the lightness of her step. The
shapeless clothes concealed the grace of the slim figure.
But even so there was a vital energy in the way she
moved.</p>
<p>Tolliver was mending the broken teeth of a hay-rake
and making a poor job of it.</p>
<p>June made a direct frontal attack. &#8220;Dad, did you
ever know a man named Pete Purdy?&#8221;</p>
<p>The rancher&#8217;s lank, unshaven jaw fell. The blow had
fallen at last. In a way he had expected it. Yet his mind
was too stunned to find any road of escape.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes&mdash;yes, I&mdash;yes, honey,&#8221; he faltered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he was a&mdash;a cowpuncher, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was Jasper Stuart, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>An explanation could no longer be dodged or avoided.
Houck had talked too much. Tolliver knew he must
make a clean breast of it, and that his own daughter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
would sit in judgment on him. Yet he hung back. The
years of furtive silence still held him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a fellow lived in Brown&#8217;s Park.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What had you to do with him? Why did Jake Houck
tell me to ask you about him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I reckon&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And about where you lived while I was with Aunt
Molly at Rawlins?&#8221; she rushed on.</p>
<p>The poor fellow moistened his dry lips. &#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;ll tell
you the whole story, honey. Mebbe I&#8217;d ought to &#8217;a&#8217;
told you long ago. But someways&mdash;&#8221; He stopped,
trying for a fresh start. &#8220;You&#8217;ll despise yore old daddy.
You sure will. Well, you got a right to. I been a mighty
bad father to you, June. Tha&#8217;s a fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>She waited, dread-filled eyes on his.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prob&#8217;ly I&#8217;d better start at the beginnin&#8217;, don&#8217;t you
reckon? I never did have any people to brag about.
Father and mother died while I was a li&#8217;l&#8217; grasshopper.
I was kinda farmed around, as you might say. Then I
come West an&#8217; got to punchin&#8217; cows. Seems like, I got
into a bad crowd. They was wild, an&#8217; they rustled more
or less. In them days there was a good many sleepers
an&#8217; mavericks on the range. I expect we used a running-iron
right smart when we wasn&#8217;t sure whose calf it
was.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was trying to put the best face on the story. June
could see that, and her heart hardened toward him.
She ignored the hungry appeal for mercy in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you stole cattle. Is that it?&#8221; She was
willing to hurt herself if she could give him pain. Had
he not ruined her life?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&mdash;I&mdash;Yes, I reckon that&#8217;s it. Our crowd
picked up calves that belonged to the big outfits like the
Diamond Slash. We drove &#8217;em up to Brown&#8217;s Park, an&#8217;
later acrost the line to Wyoming or Utah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was Jake Houck one of your crowd?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pete hesitated.</p>
<p>She cut in, with a flare of childish ferocity. &#8220;I&#8217;m
gonna know the truth. He&#8217;s not protecting you any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Jake was one of us. I met up with him right
soon after I come to Colorado.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Purdy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tha&#8217;s the name I was passin&#8217; under. I&#8217;d worked
back in Missouri for a fellow of that name. They got to
callin&#8217; me Pete Purdy, so I kinda let it go. My father&#8217;s
name was Tolliver, though. I took it&mdash;after the trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It come after I was married. I met yore maw at
Rawlins. She was workin&#8217; at the railroad restaurant
waitin&#8217; on table. For a coupla years we lived there, an&#8217;
I wish to God we&#8217;d never left. But Jake persuaded
&#8217;Lindy I&#8217;d ought to take up land, so we moved back to
the Park an&#8217; I preëmpted. Everything was all right at
first. You was born, an&#8217; we was right happy. But Jake
kep&#8217; a-pesterin&#8217; me to go in with him an&#8217; do some cattle
runnin&#8217; on the quiet. There was money in it&mdash;pretty
good money&mdash;an&#8217; yore maw was sick an&#8217; needed to go
to Denver. Jake, he advanced the money, an&#8217; o&#8217; course
I had to work in with him to pay it back. I was sorta
driven to it, looks like.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped to mop a perspiring face with a bandanna.
Tolliver was not enjoying himself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t told me yet what the trouble was,&#8221;
June said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this fellow Jas Stuart was a stock detective.
He come down for the Cattlemen&#8217;s Association to find
out who was doing the rustlin&#8217; in Brown&#8217;s Park. You
see, the Park was a kind of a place where we holed up.
There was timbered gulches in there where we could
drift cattle in an&#8217; hide &#8217;em. Then there was the Hole-in-the-Wall.
I expect you&#8217;ve heard of that too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did this Stuart find out who was doing the rustlin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was right smart an&#8217; overbearin&#8217;. Too much so
for his own good. Some of the boys served notice on him
he was liable to get dry-gulched if he didn&#8217;t take the
trail back where he come from. But Jas was right obstinate
an&#8217; he had sand in his craw. I&#8217;ll say that for him.
Well, one day he got word of a drive we was makin&#8217;.
Him an&#8217; his deputies laid in wait for us. There was
shooting an&#8217; my horse got killed. The others escaped,
but they nailed me. In the rookus Stuart had got killed.
They laid it on me. Mebbe I did it. I was shooting like
the rest. Anyhow, I was convicted an&#8217; got twenty years
in the pen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty years,&#8221; June echoed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three&mdash;four years later there was a jail break. I
got into the hills an&#8217; made my getaway. Travelin&#8217; by
night, I reached Rawlins. From there I came down here
with a freight outfit, an&#8217; I been here ever since.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped. His story was ended. June looked at the
slouchy little man with the weak mouth and the skim-milk,
lost-dog eyes. He was so palpably wretched, so
plainly the victim rather than the builder of his own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
misfortunes, that her generous heart went out warmly
to him.</p>
<p>With a little rush she had him in her arms. They
wept together, his head held tight against her immature
bosom. It was the first time she had ever known him to
break down, and she mothered him as women have from
the beginning of time.</p>
<p>&#8220;You poor Daddy. Don&#8217;t I know how it was? That
Jake Houck was to blame. He led you into it an&#8217; left
you to bear the blame,&#8221; she crooned.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t me. It&#8217;s you I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; of, honey. I done
ruined yore life, looks like. I shut you off from meeting
decent folks like other girls do. You ain&#8217;t had no show.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry about me, Dad. I&#8217;ll be all right.
What we&#8217;ve got to think about is not to let it get out
who you are. If it wasn&#8217;t for that big bully up at the
house&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She stopped, hopelessly unable to cope with the situation.
Whenever she thought of Houck her mind came to
an <i>impasse</i>. Every road of escape it traveled was blocked
by his jeering face, with the jutting jaw set in implacable
resolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t look like Jake would throw me down thataway,&#8221;
he bewailed. &#8220;I never done him a meanness. I
kep&#8217; my mouth shut when they got me an&#8217; wouldn&#8217;t
tell who was in with me. Tha&#8217;s one reason they soaked
me with so long a sentence. They was after Jake. They
kep&#8217; at me to turn state&#8217;s evidence an&#8217; get a short term.
But o&#8217; course I couldn&#8217;t do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Course not. An&#8217; now he turns on you like a coyote&mdash;after
you stood by him.&#8221; A surge of indignation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
boiled up in her. &#8220;He&#8217;s the very worst man ever I knew&mdash;an&#8217;
if he tries to do you any harm I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll settle
with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her father shook his unkempt head. &#8220;No, honey. I
been learnin&#8217; for twelve years that a man can&#8217;t do wrong
for to get out of a hole he&#8217;s in. If Jake&#8217;s mean enough to
give me up, why, I reckon I&#8217;ll have to stand the gaff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; denied June, a spark of flaming resolution in
her shining eyes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>&#8220;DON&#8217;T YOU TOUCH HIM!&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Inside the big chuck tent of the construction camp the
cook was busy forking steak to tin plates and ladling
potatoes into deep dishes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git a move on you, Red Haid,&#8221; he ordered.</p>
<p>Bob Dillon distributed the food at intervals along the
table which ran nearly the whole length of the canvas
top. From an immense coffee pot he poured the clear
brown liquid into tin cups set beside each plate. This
done, he passed out into the sunshine and beat the triangle.</p>
<p>From every tent men poured like seeds squirted from
a squeezed lemon. They were all in a hurry and they
jostled each other in their eagerness to get through the
open flap. Straw boss, wood walkers, and ground men,
they were all hungry. They ate swiftly and largely. The
cook and his flunkey were kept busy.</p>
<p>&#8220;More spuds!&#8221; called one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming up!&#8221; Dillon flung back cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoot along more biscuits!&#8221; a second ordered.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the way!&#8221; Bob announced.</p>
<p>The boss of the outfit came in leisurely after the rush.
He brought a guest with him and they sat down at the
end of the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beans!&#8221; demanded a line man, his mouth full.</p>
<p>&#8220;Headed for you!&#8221; promised the flunkey.</p>
<p>The guest of the boss was a big rangy fellow in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
early forties. Bob heard the boss call him &#8220;Jake,&#8221; and
later &#8220;Houck.&#8221; As soon as the boy had a moment to
spare he took a good look at the man. He did not like
what he saw. Was it the cold, close-set eyes, the crook
of the large nose, or the tight-lipped mouth gave the
fellow that semblance to a rapacious wolf?</p>
<p>As soon as Bob had cleaned up the dishes he set off
up the creek to meet June. The boy was an orphan and
had been brought up in a home with two hundred others.
His life had been a friendless one, which may have been
the reason that he felt a strong bond of sympathy for
the lonely girl on Piceance. He would have liked to be
an Aladdin with a wonder lamp by means of which he
could magically transform her affairs to good fortune.
Since this could not be, he gave her what he had&mdash;a
warm fellow-feeling because of the troubles that worried
her.</p>
<p>He found June waiting at their usual place of meeting.
Pete Tolliver&#8217;s forty-four hung in a scabbard along the
girl&#8217;s thigh. Bob remembered that she had spoken of
seeing a rattlesnake on the trail yesterday.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Lo, boy,&#8221; she called.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Lo, June. I met yore friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jake Houck. He was down at the camp for dinner
to-day&mdash;came in with the boss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s no friend of mine,&#8221; she said sulkily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t blame you a bit. Mr. Houck looks like one
hard citizen. I&#8217;d hate to cross him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s as tough as an old range bull. No matter what
you say or do you can&#8217;t faze him,&#8221; she replied wearily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You still hate him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More &#8217;n ever. Most o&#8217; the time. He just laughs.
He&#8217;s bound an&#8217; determined to marry me whether or not.
He will, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob looked at her, surprised. It was the first time she
had ever admitted as much. June&#8217;s slim body was
packed with a pantherish resilience. Her spirit bristled
with courage. What had come over her?</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t if you don&#8217;t want him to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t he?&#8221; June was lying on a warm flat rock.
She had been digging up dirt at the edge of it with a bit
of broken stick. Now she looked up at him with the
scorn of an experience she felt to be infinitely more
extensive than his. &#8220;A lot you know about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can he? If you an&#8217; Mr. Tolliver don&#8217;t want
him to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He just will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, June, that don&#8217;t listen reasonable to me. He&#8217;s
got you buffaloed. If you make up yore mind not to
have him&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say I&#8217;d made up my mind not to have him.
I said I hated him,&#8221; she corrected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you wouldn&#8217;t marry a fellow you hated,&#8221; he
argued.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know so much about it, Bob Dillon?&#8221;
she flared.</p>
<p>&#8220;I use what brains I&#8217;ve got. Women don&#8217;t do things
like that. There wouldn&#8217;t be any sense in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll prob&#8217;ly do it. Then you&#8217;ll know I haven&#8217;t
got a lick o&#8217; sense,&#8221; she retorted sullenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ce&#8217;tainly beat my time,&#8221; he said, puzzled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard you say more mean things about him than
everybody else put together, an&#8217; now you&#8217;re talkin&#8217;
about marryin&#8217; him. Why? What&#8217;s yore reason?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up. For a moment the morose eyes met
his. They told nothing except a dogged intention not
to tell anything.</p>
<p>But the boy was no fool. He had thought a good deal
about the lonely life she and her father led. Many men
came into this country three jumps ahead of the law.
It was not good form to ask where any one came from
unless he volunteered information about antecedent
conditions. Was it possible that Jake Houck had something
on Tolliver, that he was using his knowledge to
force June into a marriage with him? Otherwise there
would be no necessity for her to marry him. As he had
told her, it was a free land. But if Houck was coercing
her because of her fears for Tolliver, it was possible this
might be a factor in determining June to marry him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you do it, June. Don&#8217;t you marry him. He
didn&#8217;t look good to me, Houck didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Dillon went
on. He was a little excited, and his voice had lifted.</p>
<p>A man who came at this moment round the bend of
the creek was grinning unpleasantly. His eyes focused
on Dillon.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I don&#8217;t look good to you. Tha&#8217;s too bad. If
you&#8217;ll tell me what you don&#8217;t like about me I&#8217;ll make
myself over,&#8221; jeered Houck.</p>
<p>Bob was struck dumb. The crooked smile and the
stab of the eyes that went with it were menacing. He
felt goose quills running up and down his spine. This
man was one out of a thousand for physical prowess.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you was near,&#8221; the boy murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you didn&#8217;t, but you&#8217;ll know it now.&#8221; Houck
moved toward Dillon slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you, Jake Houck! Don&#8217;t you touch him!&#8221;
June shrilled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got to beat him up, June. It&#8217;s comin&#8217; to him.
D&#8217;you reckon I&#8217;ll let the flunkey of a telephone camp
interfere in my business? Why, he ain&#8217;t half man-size.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob backed away warily. This Colossus straddling
toward him would thrash him within an inch of his life.
The boy was white to the lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop! Right now!&#8221; June faced Houck resolutely,
standing between him and his victim.</p>
<p>The big fellow looked at the girl, a slim, fearless little
figure with undaunted eyes flinging out a challenge.
He laughed, delightedly, then brushed her aside with a
sweep of his arm.</p>
<p>Her eyes blazed. The smouldering passion that had
been accumulating for weeks boiled up. She dragged
out the six-shooter from its holster.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t have you touch him! I won&#8217;t! If you do I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Houck stopped in his stride, held fast by sheer amazement.
The revolver pointed straight at him. It did not
waver a hair&#8217;s breadth. He knew how well she could
shoot. Only the day before she had killed a circling
hawk with a rifle. The bird had dropped like a plummet,
dead before it struck the ground. Now, as his gaze took
in the pantherish ferocity of her tense pose, he knew
that she was keyed up for tragedy. She meant to defend
the boy from him if it resulted in homicide.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>It did not occur to him to be afraid. He laughed aloud,
half in admiration, half in derision.</p>
<p>&#8220;I b&#8217;lieve you would, you spunky li&#8217;l wild cat,&#8221; he
told her in great good humor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Run, Bob,&#8221; called June to the boy.</p>
<p>He stood, hesitating. His impulse was to turn and
fly, but he could not quite make up his mind to leave
her alone with Houck.</p>
<p>The cowman swung toward the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep back!&#8221; she ordered.</p>
<p>Her spurt of defiance tickled him immensely. He
went directly to her, his stride unfaltering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to shoot up poor Jake, do you? An&#8217; you an&#8217;
him all set for a honeymoon. Well, go to it, June. You
can&#8217;t miss now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood a yard or so from her, easy and undisturbed,
laughing in genuine enjoyment. He liked the child&#8217;s
pluck. The situation, with its salty tang of danger, was
wholly to his taste.</p>
<p>But he had disarmed the edge of June&#8217;s anger and
apprehension. His amusement was too real. It carried
the scene from tragedy to farce.</p>
<p>June&#8217;s outburst had not been entirely for the sake of
Bob. Back of the immediate cause was the desire to
break away from this man&#8217;s dominance. She had rebelled
in the hope of establishing her individual freedom.
Now she knew this was vain. What was the use of opposing
one who laughed at her heroics and ignored the
peril of his position? There was not any way to beat
him.</p>
<p>She pushed the six-shooter back into its holster and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
cried out at him bitterly. &#8220;I think you&#8217;re the devil or
one of his fiends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I think you&#8217;re an angel&mdash;sometimes,&#8221; he
mocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate you!&#8221; she said, and two rows of strong little
white teeth snapped tight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! Tha&#8217;s just a notion you got. You like me fine,
if you only knew it, girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was still shaken with the emotion through which
she had passed. &#8220;You never were nearer death, Jake
Houck, than right now a minute ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>His back to Dillon, the cowman gave a curt command.
&#8220;Hit the trail, boy&mdash;sudden.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob looked at June, whose sullen eyes were fighting
those of her father&#8217;s guest. She had forgotten he was
there. Without a word Bob vanished.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you love me well enough to shoot me, do you?&#8221;
Houck jeered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could!&#8221; she cried furiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t. You had yore chance, an&#8217; you
couldn&#8217;t. What you need is a master, some one you&#8217;ll
have to honor an&#8217; obey, some one who&#8217;ll look after you
an&#8217; take the devil outa you. Meanin&#8217; me&mdash;Jake
Houck. Understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t! I won&#8217;t!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You come here an&#8217;
bully me because&mdash;because of what you know about
Father. If you were half a man&mdash;if you were white,
you wouldn&#8217;t try to use that against me like you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m using it for you. Why, you li&#8217;l&#8217; spitfire, can&#8217;t
you see as Jake Houck&#8217;s wife you get a chance to live?
You&#8217;ll have clothes an&#8217; shoes an&#8217; pretties like other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
folks instead o&#8217; them rags you wear now. I aim to be
good to you, June.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>say</i> that. Don&#8217;t I know you? I&#8217;d &#8217;most rather
be dead than married to you. But you keep pesterin&#8217;
me. I&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221; Her voice broke.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217; know what&#8217;s best for you, I do. To-morrow
I got to go to Meeker. I&#8217;ll be back Thursday.
We&#8217;ll ride over to Bear Cat Friday an&#8217; be married.
Tha&#8217;s how we&#8217;ll fix it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not take her in his arms or try to kiss her. The
man was wise in his generation. Cheerfully, as a matter
of course, he continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go up to the house an&#8217; tell Tolliver it&#8217;s all
settled.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lagged back, sulkily, still protesting. &#8220;It&#8217;s not
settled, either. You don&#8217;t run everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>But in her heart she was afraid he had stormed the
last trench of her resistance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>AN ELOPEMENT</h3>
</div>

<p>Bob Dillon was peeling potatoes outside the chuck
tent when he heard a whistle he recognized instantly.
It was a very good imitation of a meadow-lark&#8217;s joyous
lilt. He answered it, put down the pan and knife, and
rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where you going?&#8221; demanded the cook.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back in a minute, Lon,&#8221; the flunkey told him, and
followed a cow trail that took him up the hill through
the sage.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never did see a fellow like him,&#8221; the cook communed
aloud to himself. &#8220;A bird calls, an&#8217; he&#8217;s got to
quit work to find out what it wants. Kinda nice kid,
too, if he is queer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the piñons at the rock rim above Bob found
June. He had not seen her since the day when she had
saved him from a thrashing. The boy was not very
proud of the way he had behaved. If he had not shown
the white feather, he had come dangerously close to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are cases, June?&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes, which had been rather dodging hers, came
to rest on the girl at last. One glance told him that she
was in trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217; know what to do, Bob,&#8221; she broke out. &#8220;Jake
will be back to-day&mdash;by dinner-time, I reckon. He
says I&#8217;ve got to go with him to Bear Cat an&#8217; be married
to-morrow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>Dillon opened his lips to speak, but he said nothing.
He remembered how he had counseled her to boldness
before and failed at the pinch. What advice could he
give? What could he say to comfort his friend?</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you got any folks you could go to&mdash;some
one who would tell Houck where to head in at?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head. &#8220;My father&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t he help you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He would, but&mdash;I can&#8217;t ask him. I got to pretend
to him I&#8217;d just as lief marry Jake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you why, Bob. But that&#8217;s how it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you still hate Houck?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ump-ha. Except&mdash;sometimes.&#8221; She did not explain
that elusive answer. &#8220;But it don&#8217;t matter about
how I feel. When he comes back I&#8217;ve got to do like
he says.&#8221;</p>
<p>June broke down and began to weep. The boy&#8217;s tender
heart melted within him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you. Don&#8217;t you,&#8221; he begged. &#8220;We&#8217;ll find a
way, li&#8217;l&#8217; pardner. We sure will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; she asked, between sobs. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t&mdash;any
way&mdash;except to&mdash;to marry Jake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could run away&mdash;and work,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;d give me work? And where could I go that he
wouldn&#8217;t find me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Practical details stumped him. Her objections were
valid enough. With her inexperience she could never
face the world alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, le&#8217;s see. You&#8217;ve got friends. Somewhere that
you could kinda hide for a while.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not a friend. We&mdash;we don&#8217;t make friends,&#8221; she
said in a small, forlorn voice with a catch in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got one,&#8221; he said stoutly. &#8220;Maybe he don&#8217;t
amount to much, but&mdash;&#8221; He broke off, struck by an
idea. &#8220;Say, June, why couldn&#8217;t you run off with me?
We&#8217;d go clear away, where he wouldn&#8217;t find us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could I run off with you?&#8221; A pink flood poured
into her face. &#8220;You&#8217;re not my brother. You&#8217;re no kin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but&mdash;&#8221; He frowned at the ground, kicking at
a piece of moss with his toe to help him concentrate.
Again he found an idea. &#8220;We could get married.&#8221;</p>
<p>This left her staring at him, speechless.</p>
<p>He began to dress his proposal with arguments. He
was a humble enough youth who had played a trifling
part in life. But his imagination soared at seeing himself
a rescuer of distressed maidens. He was a dreamer of
dreams. In them he bulked large and filled heroic rôles
amply.</p>
<p>June was a practical young person. &#8220;What d&#8217; you
want to marry me for?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>He came to earth. He did not want to marry her. At
least he had not wanted to until the moment before. If
he had been able to give the reason for his suggestion, it
would probably have been that her complete isolation
and helplessness appealed to the same conditions in himself
and to a certain youthful chivalry.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re good pals, ain&#8217;t we?&#8221; was the best he could do
by way of answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but you don&#8217;t&mdash;you don&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Beneath the tan of her dark cheeks the blood poured
in again. It was as hard for her to talk about love as for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
him. She felt the same shy, uneasy embarrassment, as
though it were some subject taboo, not to be discussed
by sane-minded people.</p>
<p>His freckled face matched hers in color. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
have to be thataway. If we like each other, an&#8217; if it
looks like the best thing to do&mdash;why&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t leave Dad,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to leave him if you marry Jake Houck.&#8221;</p>
<p>That brought her to another aspect of the situation.
If she ran away with Bob and married him, what would
Houck do in regard to her father? Some deep instinct
told her that he would not punish Tolliver for it if she
went without his knowledge. The man was ruthless,
but he was not needlessly cruel.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would we do? Where would we go&mdash;afterward?&#8221;
she asked.</p>
<p>He waved a hand largely into space. &#8220;Anywhere.
Denver, maybe. Or Cheyenne. Or Salt Lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d we live?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d get work. No trouble about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She considered the matter, at first unsentimentally,
as a workable proposition. In spite of herself she could
not hold quite to that aspect of the case. Her blood
began to beat faster. She would escape Houck. That
was the fundamental advantage of the plan. But she
would see the world. She would meet people. Perhaps
for the first time she would ride on a train. Wonderful
stories had been told her by Dillon, of how colored men
cooked and served meals on a train rushing along forty
miles an hour, of how they pulled beds down from the
roof and folks went to sleep in little rooms just as though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
they were at home. She would see all the lovely things
he had described to her. There was a court-house in
Denver where you got into a small room and it traveled
up with you till you got out and looked down four stories
from a window.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we go it&#8217;ll have to be right away,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Without tellin&#8217; anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could go back to the house an&#8217; get my things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;While I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; mine. There&#8217;s nobody at the
camp but Lon, an&#8217; he always sleeps after he gets through
work. But how&#8217;ll we get to Bear Cat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bring the buckboard. Dad&#8217;s away. I&#8217;ll leave
him a note. Meet you in half an hour on Twelve-Mile
Hill,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>It was so arranged.</p>
<p>June ran back to the house, hitched the horses to the
buckboard, and changed to her best dress. She made a
little bundle of her other clothes and tied them in a
bandanna handkerchief.</p>
<p>On a scrap of coarse brown wrapping-paper she wrote
a short note:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Dad</span>,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going away with Bob Dillon. We&#8217;re going to be married.
Don&#8217;t blame me too much. Jake Houck drove me to it.
I&#8217;ll write you soon. Don&#8217;t forget to take the cough medicine
when you need it.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>June</span></p>
</div>

</div>
<p>She added a postscript.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave the team at Kilburn&#8217;s Corral.</p>
</div>
<p>Unexpectedly, she found herself crying. Tears
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
splashed on the writing. She folded the note, put it in
the empty coffee pot, and left this on the table.</p>
<p>June had no time just now for doubts. The horses
were half-broken broncos. They traveled the first hundred
yards tied in a knot, the buckboard sometimes on
four wheels, but more often on two.</p>
<p>At the top of the hill she managed to slacken them
enough for Bob to jump in. They were off again as
though shot from a bow. June wound the reins round
her hands and leaned back, arms and strong thin wrists
taut. The colts flew over the ground at a gallop.</p>
<p>There was no chance for conversation. Bob watched
the girl drive. He offered no advice. She was, he knew,
a better teamster than himself. Her eyes and mind were
wholly on the business in hand.</p>
<p>A flush of excitement burned in June&#8217;s cheeks. Tolliver
never would let her drive the colts because of the
danger. She loved the stimulation of rapid travel, the
rush of the wind past her ears, the sense of responsibility
at holding the lines.</p>
<p>Bob clung to the seat and braced himself. He knew
that all June could do was to steady the team enough to
keep the horses in the road. Every moment he expected
a smash, but it did not come. The colts reached the foot
of Twelve-Mile safely and swept up the slope beyond.
The driver took a new grip on the lines and put her
weight on them. It was a long hill. By the time they
reached the top the colts were under control and ready
to behave for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>The sparkling eyes of June met those of Bob. &#8220;Great,
ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>He nodded, but it had not been fun for him. He had
been distinctly frightened. He felt for June the reluctant
admiration gameness compels from those who are
constitutionally timid. What manner of girl was this
who could shave disaster in such a reckless fashion and
actually enjoy it?</p>
<p>At the edge of the town they exchanged seats at
June&#8217;s suggestion and Bob drove in. It was mid-afternoon
by the sun as he tied the horses to the rack in front
of the larger of the two general stores.</p>
<p>&#8220;You stay here,&#8221; the boy advised. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get things
fixed, then come back an&#8217; let you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had only a hazy idea of the business details of
getting married, but he knew a justice of the peace could
tell him. He wandered down the street in search of one.</p>
<p>Half a dozen cowpunchers bent on sport drifted in
his direction. One of them was riding down the dusty
road. To the horn of his saddle a rope was tied. The
other end of it was attached to a green hide of a steer
dragging after him.</p>
<p>The punchers made a half-circle round Bob.</p>
<p>One grinned and made comment. &#8220;Here&#8217;s one looks
ripe, fellows. Jes&#8217; a-honin&#8217; for a ride, looks like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Betcha he don&#8217;t last ten jumps,&#8221; another said.</p>
<p>Before Bob could offer any resistance or make any
protest he had been jubilantly seized and dumped down
on the hide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;er go,&#8221; some one shouted.</p>
<p>The horse, at the touch of the spur, jumped to a gallop.
Bob felt a sudden sick sense of helplessness. The
earth was cut out from under him. He crouched low and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
tried to cling to the slippery hide as it bounced forward.
Each leap of the bronco upset him. Within three seconds
he had ridden on his head, his back, and his stomach.
Wildly he clawed at the rope as he rolled over.</p>
<p>With a yell the rider swung a corner. Bob went off
the hide at a tangent, rolling over and over in the yellow
four-inch-deep dust.</p>
<p>He got up, dizzy and perplexed. His best suit looked
as though it had been through a long and severe war.</p>
<p>A boyish puncher came up and grinned at him in the
friendliest way. &#8220;Hello, fellow! Have a good ride?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob smiled through the dust he had accumulated.
&#8220;It didn&#8217;t last long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most generally it don&#8217;t. Come in to Dolan&#8217;s an&#8217;
have a drink.&#8221; He mentioned his name. It was Dud
Hollister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t.&#8221; Bob followed an impulse. &#8220;Say, how do
you get married?&#8221; he asked, lowering his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Dud answered promptly. &#8220;Not so long as
I&#8217;m in my right mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean, how do I?&#8221; He added sheepishly, &#8220;She&#8217;s
in the buckboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Dud fell to sudden sobriety. This was serious
business. &#8220;I&#8217;d get a license at the cou&#8217;t-house. Then
go see Blister Haines. He&#8217;s the J. P.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob equipped himself with a license, returned to June,
and reported progress.</p>
<p>The bride-to-be was simmering with indignation. In
those days she had not yet cultivated a sense of humor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw what they did to you&mdash;the brutes,&#8221; she
snapped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! That wasn&#8217;t nothin&#8217;, June. The boys was
only funnin&#8217;. Well, I got things fixed. We gotta go to
the J. P.&#8221;</p>
<p>The justice was having forty winks when they entered
his office. He was enormously fat, a fact notable in a
country of lean men. Moreover, he had neither eyebrows
nor hair, though his face announced him not more
than thirty in spite of its triple chin. Mr. Haines was
slumped far down in a big armchair out of which he
overflowed prodigally. His feet were on a second chair.</p>
<p>Bob wakened him ruthlessly. He sat up blinking.
Bob started to speak. He stopped him with a fat uplifted
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I r-reckon I know what <i>you</i> want, y-young man,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>BLISTER GIVES ADVICE</h3>
</div>

<p>Blister Haines, J. P., was by way of being a character.
His waggish viewpoint was emphasized by a slight stutter.</p>
<p>&#8220;S-so you want to h-hitch up to double trouble, do
you?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to get married,&#8221; Bob said.</p>
<p>&#8220;S-same thing,&#8221; the fat man wheezed, grinning.
&#8220;C-come right in an&#8217; I&#8217;ll tie you tighter &#8217;n a d-drum.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only got six dollars,&#8221; the bridegroom explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter a-tall. My f-fee is jus&#8217; six d-dollars,&#8221; the
justice announced promptly.</p>
<p>Bob hesitated. June nudged him and whispered. The
husband-elect listened, nodded, and spoke up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pay you two dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blister looked at the bride reproachfully. &#8220;L-lady, if
you ain&#8217;t worth s-six dollars to him you ain&#8217;t worth a
c-cent. But I&#8217;ll show you how good a sport I am. I&#8217;ll
m-make you a wedding present of the j-job. Got any
witnesses?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do we have to have witnesses?&#8221; asked Bob helplessly.
Getting married was a more formidable and
formal affair than he had supposed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. I&#8217;ll dig &#8217;em up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The justice waddled to the door of the saloon adjoining
and stuck his head inside. A row of cowpunchers
were lined up in front of the bar.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Y-you, Dud Hollister an&#8217; Tom Reeves, I&#8217;m servin&#8217;
a subpoena on you lads as w-witnesses at a w-weddin&#8217;,&#8221;
he said in the high wheeze that sounded so funny coming
from his immense bulk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose wedding?&#8221; demanded Reeves, a lank youth
with a brick-red face, the nose of which had been broken.</p>
<p>&#8220;N-none of yore darned business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do we get to kiss the bride?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You h-hotfoot it right to my office or I&#8217;ll throw
you in the c-calaboose for c-contempt of court, Tom
Reeves.&#8221;</p>
<p>The puncher turned to Hollister, grinning. &#8220;Come
along, Dud. Might &#8217;s well learn how it&#8217;s done, ol&#8217; Sure-Shot.&#8221;</p>
<p>The range-riders jingled into the office at the heels of
the justice. Blister inquired for the names of the principals
and introduced the witnesses to them. The gayety
and the audacity of the punchers had vanished.
They ducked their heads and drew back a foot each in a
scrape that was meant to be a bow. They were almost
as embarrassed as June and Bob. Which is saying a
good deal.</p>
<p>June had not realized what an ordeal it would be to
stand up before strangers in her dingy dress and heavy
cracked brogans while she promised to love, honor, and
obey. She was acutely conscious of her awkwardness,
of the flying, rebellious hair, of a hole in a stocking she
tried to keep concealed. And for the first time, too, she
became aware of the solemnity of what she was doing.
The replies she gave were low and confused.</p>
<p>Before she knew it the ceremony was over.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>Blister closed the book and dropped it on a chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiss yore wife, man,&#8221; he admonished, chuckling.</p>
<p>Bob flushed to the roots of his hair. He slid a look at
June, not sure whether she would want him to do that.
Her long dark lashes had fallen to the dusky cheeks and
hid the downcast eyes.</p>
<p>His awkward peck caught her just below the ear.</p>
<p>The bridegroom offered the justice two dollars. Blister
took it and handed it to June.</p>
<p>&#8220;You keep it, ma&#8217;am, an&#8217; buy yorese&#8217;f somethin&#8217; for
a p-pretty. I&#8217;d jes&#8217; b-blow it anyhow. Hope you&#8217;ll be
r-real happy. If this yere young s-scalawag don&#8217;t treat
you h-handsome, Tom an&#8217; Dud&#8217;ll be glad to ride over
an&#8217; beat him up proper &#8217;most any time you give &#8217;em the
high sign. Am I right, boys?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure are,&#8221; they said, grinning bashfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;As j-justice of the peace for Garfield County, S-state
of C-colorado, I&#8217;m entitled to k-kiss the bride, but mos&#8217;
generally I give her one o&#8217; these heart-to-heart talks
instead, onloadin&#8217; from my chest some f-free gratis
g-good advice,&#8221; the fat man explained in his hoarse
wheeze. &#8220;You got to r-remember, ma&#8217;am, that m-marriage
ain&#8217;t duck soup for n-neither the one nor the other
of the h-high contractin&#8217; parties thereto. It&#8217;s a g-game
of give an&#8217; take, an&#8217; at that a h-heap more give than
take.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; murmured June tremulously, looking
down at the hole in her stocking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whilst I n-never yet c-committed matrimony in my
own p-person, me being ample provided with t-trouble
an&#8217; satisfied with what griefs I already got, yet I&#8217;ve run
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
cows off an&#8217; on, an&#8217; so have had workin&#8217; for me several
of this sex you&#8217;ve now got tangled up with, ma&#8217;am,&#8221;
Blister sailed on cheerfully. &#8220;I&#8217;ll say the best way to
keep &#8217;em contented is to feed &#8217;em good, treat &#8217;em as if
they was human, an&#8217; in general give &#8217;em a more or less
free rein, dependin&#8217; on their g-general habits an&#8217; cussedness.
If that don&#8217;t suit a p-puncher I most usually
h-hand him his hat an&#8217; say, &#8216;So long, son, you &#8217;n&#8217; me
ain&#8217;t c-consanguineously constructed to ride the same
range; no hard feelin&#8217;s, but if you&#8217;re w-wishful to jog on
to another outfit I&#8217;ll say adios without no tears.&#8217; You
can&#8217;t g-get rid of yore husband that easy, ma&#8217;am, so I&#8217;ll
recommend the g-good grub, s-seventy-five s-smiles per
diem, an&#8217; the aforesaid more or less f-free rein.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again June whispered, &#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; but this time her
honest eyes lifted and went straight into his.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you.&#8221; The justice turned his batteries on the
groom. &#8220;You w-wanta recollect that this r-road you&#8217;ve
done chose ain&#8217;t no easy one to t-travel. Tenderfoot
come in the other day an&#8217; w-wanted to know what kind
of a road it was to S-stinking Creek. I tell him it&#8217;s a
g-good road. Yesterday he come rarin&#8217; in to f-find out
what I told him that for. &#8216;Fellow,&#8217; I says, &#8216;Fellow, any
r-road you can g-get over is a good road in this country.&#8217;
It&#8217;s t-thataway with marriage, son, an&#8217; don&#8217;t you forget
it a h-holy minute. Another thing, this being u-united
in wedlock ain&#8217;t no sinecure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t no which kind of a sin?&#8221; inquired Reeves.</p>
<p>Dud Hollister grinned admiringly. &#8220;Blister sure
ropes an&#8217; hogties a heap of longhorn words.&#8221;</p>
<p>The justice scratched his bald poll and elucidated.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
&#8220;A s-sinecure, boys, is when a f-fellow rides the g-grub
line habitual an&#8217; don&#8217;t rope no d-dogies for his stack o&#8217;
wheats an&#8217; c-coffee.&#8221; He wagged a fat forefinger at Bob.
&#8220;You gotta quit hellin&#8217; around now an&#8217; behave yorese&#8217;f
like a respectable m-married man. You gotta dig in an&#8217;
work. At that you &#8217;n&#8217; the little lady will have yore flareups.
When you do, give her the best of it an&#8217; you&#8217;ll
never be sorry. Tha&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blister slid a hand furtively into a drawer of the desk,
groped for a moment, then flung a handful of rice over
bride and groom.</p>
<p>The newly married couple left the office hurriedly.
They did not look at each other. An acute shyness had
swept over both of them. They walked to the buckboard,
still without speaking.</p>
<p>June opened a perspiring little brown palm in which
lay two warm silver dollars. &#8220;Here&#8217;s yore money,&#8221; she
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s yours. He gave it to you,&#8221; Bob answered, swallowing
hard. &#8220;For a weddin&#8217; present.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I ain&#8217;t no pockets. You keep it for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The transfer was accomplished, neither of them looking
into the eyes of the other.</p>
<p>Blister Haines, flanked on each side by one of the
witnesses, rolled past on his way to the bar of the Bear
Cat House. His throat was dry and he proposed to
liquidate his unusual exertion. He always celebrated a
wedding by taking a few drinks. Any excuse was a good
excuse for that. He waved a hand toward the newlyweds
in greeting.</p>
<p>Bob answered by lifting his own. He had not taken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
three drinks in his life, but he felt that he would like one
now. It might cheer him up a little.</p>
<p>What in the world was he to do with June? Where
could he take her for the night? And after that what
would they do? He had not money enough to pay stage
fare to get them away. He did not know anybody from
whom he could borrow any. Yet even if he found work
in Bear Cat, they dared not stay here. Houck would
come &#8220;rip-raring&#8221; down from the hills and probably
murder him.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it would not do for him to act as though he
were stumped. He managed a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better take the team to the corral, then go get
something to eat, June. I&#8217;m sure enough hungry. Ain&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded. Even to go to the hotel or a restaurant
for dinner was an adventure for her, so little of experience
had her life offered.</p>
<p>As they walked from the barn to the Bear Cat House,
the girl-bride was still dumb. The marriage ceremony
had brought home to her the solemnity of what she had
done. She had promised to love, honor, and obey this
boy, to care for him in sickness and in health, till death
came to part them.</p>
<p>What did she know about him? What manner of man
had she married? The consequences of the step they had
taken began to appall her. She would have to live with
him in all the intimacies of married life, cook for him,
wash his clothes, sit opposite him at the table three
times a day for fifty years. He was to be the father of
her children, and she knew nothing whatever about him
except that he was gentle and friendly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>From under long curving lashes she stole a shy look at
him. He was her husband, this stranger. Would she be
able to please him? June thought of what Blister Haines
had said. She was a pretty good cook. That was one
thing. And she would try not to let herself sulk or be
a spitfire. Maybe he would not get tired of her if she
worked real hard to suit him.</p>
<p>The hotel was an adobe building. In the doorway
stood a woman leaning against the jamb. She was smoking
a cigar. June looked twice at her before she believed
her eyes.</p>
<p>The woman took the cigar from between her lips.
&#8220;Are you the children Blister Haines just married?&#8221;
she asked bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&mdash;we&#8217;ve just been married by Mr. Haines,&#8221;
Bob replied with an attempt at dignity.</p>
<p>The blue eyes of the woman softened as she looked
at June&mdash;softened indescribably. They read instantly
the doubt and loneliness of the child. She threw the
cigar into the street and moved swiftly toward the
bride. A moment before she had been hard and sexless,
in June&#8217;s virgin eyes almost a monstrosity. Now she
was all mother, filled with the protective instinct.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Mollie Gillespie&mdash;keep the hotel here,&#8221; she
explained. &#8220;You come right in an&#8217; I&#8217;ll fix up a nice
room for you, my dearie. You can wash up after yore
ride and you&#8217;ll feel a lot better. I&#8217;ll have Chung Lung
cook you both a bit of supper soon as he comes back to
the kitchen. A good steak an&#8217; some nice French frys,
say. With some of the mince pie left from dinner and a
good cup of coffee.&#8221; Mollie&#8217;s arm was round June, petting
and comforting her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>June felt and repressed an impulse to tears. &#8220;You&#8217;re
mighty good,&#8221; she gulped.</p>
<p>The landlady of the Bear Cat House bustled the girl
into a room and began to mother her. Bob hung around
the door. He did not know whether he was expected to
come in or stay out, though he knew which he wanted
to do.</p>
<p>Mollie sent him about his business. &#8220;Scat!&#8221; she
snapped. &#8220;Get outa here, Mr. Husband, an&#8217; don&#8217;t you
show up till five o&#8217;clock prompt. Hear me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob heard and vanished like a tin-canned pup. He
was the most relieved youth in Bear Cat. At least he
had a reprieve. Mrs. Gillespie would know what to do
and how to do it.</p>
<p>If being a married man was like this, he did not wonder
that Dud Hollister and Blister Haines felt the way
they did toward that holy estate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE WHITE FEATHER</h3>
</div>

<p>At the appointed time Bob sneaked back to the hotel.
He hung around the lobby for a minute or two, drifted
into the saloon and gambling annex, and presently found
himself hanging over the bar because he did not know
what else to do with himself.</p>
<p>Was he to go to the room after June and bring her to
supper? Or was he to wait until she came out? He
wished he knew.</p>
<p>Mollie caught sight of him and put a flea in his ear.
&#8220;What d&#8217; you think you&#8217;re doing here, young fellow,
me lad? Get outa this den of iniquity an&#8217; hustle back to
the room where the little lady is waitin&#8217; for you. Hear
me?&#8221; she snorted.</p>
<p>A minute later Bob was knocking timidly on the door
of room 9. A small voice told him to come in. He opened
the door.</p>
<p>June shyly met the eyes of her husband. &#8220;Mrs. Gillespie
said maybe you&#8217;d want to wash up before supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;d be a good idee,&#8221; he said, shifting
from one foot to the other.</p>
<p>Did she expect him to wash here? Or what?</p>
<p>June poured water into the basin and found a towel.</p>
<p>Not for a five-dollar bill would Bob have removed his
coat, though there had never been a time in his young
life when he would have welcomed more a greenback.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
He did not intend to be indelicate while alone with a
young woman in a bedroom. The very thought of it
made him scarlet to the roots of his red hair.</p>
<p>After he had scrubbed himself till his face was like a
shining apple, June lent him a comb. She stole a furtive
look at him while he was standing before the small
cracked mirror. For better or worse he was her man.
She had to make the best of him. A sense of proprietorship
that was almost pride glowed faintly in her. He was
a nice boy, even if he was so thin and red and freckled.
Bob would be good to her. She was sure of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Gillespie said she reckoned she could fix you
up a job to help the cook,&#8221; the bride said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;to-night or for good?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right along, she said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob did not welcome the suggestion. There was an
imperative urge within him to get away from Bear Cat
before Jake Houck arrived. There was no use dodging
it. He was afraid of the fellow&#8217;s vengeance. This was a
country where men used firearms freely. The big man
from Brown&#8217;s Park might shoot him down at sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon we&#8217;d better stay here,&#8221; he answered
uneasily. &#8220;In a bigger town I can get a better job
likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we haven&#8217;t money enough to go on the stage,
have we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If there was a bull team going out mebbe I could
work my way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;W-e-ll.&#8221; She considered this dubiously. &#8220;If we
stayed here Mrs. Gillespie would let me wash dishes an&#8217;
all. She said she&#8217;d give me two dollars a week an&#8217; my
board. Tha&#8217;s a lot of money, Bob.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>He looked out of the window. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want trouble
with Jake Houck. It&mdash;it would worry you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but&mdash;&#8221; June did not quite know how to say
what was in her mind. She had an instinctive feeling
that the way to meet trouble was to face it unafraid and
not to run away from it. &#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon we&#8217;d better
show Jake we&#8217;re scared of him&mdash;now. O&#8217; course he&#8217;ll
be mad at first, but he&#8217;s got no right to be. Jes&#8217; &#8217;cause
he kep&#8217; a-pesterin&#8217; me don&#8217;t give him no claim on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but you know what he is an&#8217; how he acts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go where you want to go. I jes&#8217; thought, seein&#8217;
how good to us Mrs. Gillespie has been, that maybe&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll talk it over after supper,&#8221; Bob said.
&#8220;I&#8217;m for lighting out myself. To Laramie or Cheyenne,
say.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they had not eaten since breakfast they were a
pair of hungry young animals. They did full justice to
the steak, French frys, mince pie, and coffee Mrs. Gillespie
had promised.</p>
<p>They hung for a moment awkwardly outside the
dining-room. Both of them were looking for an excuse
to avoid returning to their room yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like to look the town over?&#8221; Bob asked.</p>
<p>June accepted eagerly.</p>
<p>They walked up the single business street and looked
in the windows. The young husband bought his bride
a paper sack of chocolates and they ate them as they
strolled. Somehow they did not feel half as shy of each
other in the open as when shut up together between the
walls of a bedroom.</p>
<p>Dusk was beginning to fall. It veiled the crude and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
callow aspects of the frontier town and filled the hollows
of the surrounding hills with a soft violet haze.</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s eyes met the dark orbs of June. Between them
some communication flashed. For the first time a queer
emotion clutched at the boy&#8217;s heart. An intoxicating
thrill pulsed through his veins. She was his wife, this
shy girl so flushed and tender.</p>
<p>His hand caught hers and gave it a little comforting
pressure. It was his first love gesture and it warmed her
like wine.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right good to me,&#8221; she murmured.</p>
<p>She was grateful for so little. All her life she had been
starved for love and friendship just as he had. Bob resolved
to give them to her in a flood. A great tide of
sympathy flowed out from him to her. He would be
good to her. He wished she knew now how well he
meant to look after her. But he could not tell her. A
queer shame tied his tongue.</p>
<p>From a blacksmith shop a man stepped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, fellow, can I see you a minute?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>It was Dud Hollister. He drew Bob back into the
smithy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Big guy in town lookin&#8217; for you. He&#8217;s tankin&#8217; up.
You heeled?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob felt as though his heart had been drenched with
ice water. Houck was here then. Already.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&mdash;I don&#8217;t carry a gun,&#8221; he replied, weakly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s mine. Shoots just a mite high, but she&#8217;s a
good old friend.&#8221; Dud pressed a six-shooter on Dillon.</p>
<p>The boy took it reluctantly. The blood in his veins
ran cold. &#8220;I dunno. I reckon mebbe I better not. If I
talked to him, don&#8217;t you think&mdash;?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Talk, hell! He&#8217;s out for blood, that guy is. He&#8217;s
made his brags right over the bar at Dolan&#8217;s what all
he&#8217;s gonna do to you. I&#8217;m no gunman, understand.
But a fellow&#8217;s got to look out for number one. I&#8217;d let
him have it soon as I seen him. Right off the reel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surest thing you know. He&#8217;s a bad actor, that fellow
is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I went to the marshal&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Dud&#8217;s eye held derision. &#8220;What good&#8217;d that do?
Simp ain&#8217;t gonna draw cards <i>till after some one&#8217;s been
gunned</i>. He don&#8217;t claim to be no mind-reader, Simp
don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not lookin&#8217; for trouble,&#8221; Bob began to explain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fellow, it&#8217;s lookin&#8217; for you,&#8221; cut in Dud. &#8220;You hold
that gun right under yore coat, an&#8217; when you meet up
with Mr. Hook or whoever he is, don&#8217;t you wait to ask
&#8216;What for?&#8217; Go to fannin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob rejoined June. His lips were bloodless. He felt a
queer weakness in the knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he want?&#8221; asked June.</p>
<p>&#8220;Houck&#8217;s here&mdash;lookin&#8217; for me,&#8221; the wretched boy
explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you&#8217;ve got under yore coat?&#8221; she demanded
quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a&mdash;a gun. He made me take it. Said Houck
was tellin&#8217; how he&#8217;d&mdash;do for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fear-filled eyes of the boy met the stricken ones of
his bride. She knew now what she had before suspected
and would not let herself believe.</p>
<p>If it was possible she must help him to avoid a meeting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
with Houck. She could not have him shamed. Her
savage young pride would not permit the girl to mate
with one who proved himself a coward at a crisis of his
life. It was necessary to her self-respect that she save
his.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better go back to the hotel,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You
can stay in our room, and I&#8217;ll send for Jake an&#8217; talk
with him downstairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon I&#8217;d better do that,&#8221; Bob protested
feebly. &#8220;He might&mdash;hurt you. No tellin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>June ignored this. &#8220;Did you hear whether Dad&#8217;s
with him?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Jake?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was at Dolan&#8217;s drinking when that Dud Hollister
seen him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have him come right away&mdash;before he&#8217;s had
too much. Dad says he used to be mean when he was
drinkin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hotel was in the same block as Dolan&#8217;s, a hundred
feet beyond it. They were passing the saloon when
the door was pushed open and a man came out. At
sight of them he gave a triumphant whoop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got ya!&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>The look on his face daunted Bob. The boy felt the
courage dry up within him. Mouth and throat parched.
He tried to speak and found he could not.</p>
<p>June took up the gage, instantly, defiantly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
got nothing to do with us, Jake Houck. We&#8217;re married.&#8221;</p>
<p>The news had reached him. He looked at her blackly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
&#8220;Married or single, you&#8217;re mine, girl, an&#8217; you&#8217;re going
with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My husband will have a word to say about that,&#8221;
June boasted bravely.</p>
<p>Houck looked at his rival, and a sinister, mocking
smile creased the hard face. &#8220;I&#8217;m plumb scared of
him,&#8221; he jeered.</p>
<p>&#8220;We g-got a right to get married, Mr. Houck,&#8221; Bob
said, teeth chattering. &#8220;You hadn&#8217;t ought to make us
trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaks up right brave, don&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s as brave as you are, Jake Houck, even if he
ain&#8217;t a bully,&#8221; the bride flamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;So?&#8221; Houck moved a step or two toward Dillon.</p>
<p>The hand under the coat shook as though the boy had
a chill.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you got there&mdash;in yore hand?&#8221; demanded
Houck.</p>
<p>The revolver came to light.</p>
<p>Houck stuck his hands in his trouser pockets, straddled
out his feet, and laughed derisively. &#8220;Allowin&#8217; for
to kill me, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221; The voice was a dry whisper. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to
talk this over reasonable, Mr. Houck, an&#8217; fix it up so&#8217;s
bygones would be bygones. I ain&#8217;t lookin&#8217; for trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure believe that.&#8221; Houck turned to June. &#8220;It
wouldn&#8217;t be safe for me to leave you with this desperate
character who goes around with a six-shooter not lookin&#8217;
for trouble. I&#8217;m aimin&#8217; to take you with me, like I
said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes clashed with his and gave way at last. &#8220;You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
always act like you&#8217;re God Almighty,&#8221; she cried passionately.
&#8220;Are you hard o&#8217; hearing? I&#8217;m married to
Bob Dillon here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t heard him raise any objections to yore goin&#8217;,&#8221;
Houck taunted. &#8220;Tolliver said for me to bring
you, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>June spoke to Bob, her voice trembling. &#8220;Tell him
where to get off at,&#8221; she begged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Houck, June&#8217;s my wife. She&#8217;s made her choice.
That ends it,&#8221; Bob said unsteadily.</p>
<p>The cold, cruel eyes of the ex-rustler gripped those of
Dillon and held them. &#8220;End it, does it? Listen. If
you&#8217;re any kind of a man a-tall you&#8217;d better shoot me
right now. I&#8217;m gonna take her from you, an&#8217; you&#8217;re
goin&#8217; to tell her to go with me. Understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll not tell me any such a thing,&#8221; June protested.
But her heart sank. She was not sure whether her husband
would grovel. If he did&mdash;if he did&mdash;</p>
<p>The jeering voice went on taunting its victim. &#8220;If I
was you I&#8217;d use that gun or I&#8217;d crawl into a hole. Ain&#8217;t
you got any spunk a-tall? I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; you that June&#8217;s
goin&#8217; with me instead o&#8217; you, an&#8217; that you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to tell
her to go. Tha&#8217;s the kind of a man she married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Houck, I don&#8217;t reckon&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Houck moved forward, evenly, without haste, eyes
cold as chilled steel and as unyielding. &#8220;Gimme that
gun, if you ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to use it.&#8221; He held out a hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Bob,&#8221; begged June, in a panic of dismay.</p>
<p>While his heart fluttered with apprehension Bob told
himself, over and over, that he would not hand the revolver
to Houck. He was still saying it when his right
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
arm began to move slowly forward. The weapon passed
from one to the other.</p>
<p>June gave a sobbing sound of shame and despair.
She felt like a swimmer in a swift current when the deep
waters are closing over his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now tell her you ain&#8217;t good enough for her, that
you&#8217;ve got no sand in yore craw, and she&#8217;s to go with
me,&#8221; ordered Houck.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Young Dillon&#8217;s voice came dry from a throat
like cotton.</p>
<p>The big man caught Bob&#8217;s wrist and slowly twisted.
The boy gave an agonized howl of pain. June was white
to the lips, but she made no attempt to interfere. It
was too late. Bob must show the stuff that was in him.
He must go through to a fighting finish or he must
prove himself a weakling.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you give her up now, you&#8217;re a yellow dog, Dillon,&#8221;
his tormentor sneered. &#8220;Stick it out. Tell me to
go to red-hot blazes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took an extra turn on the wrist. Bob writhed and
shrieked. Tiny beads of perspiration stood on his forehead.
&#8220;You&#8217;re killin&#8217; me!&#8221; he screamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wish you&#8217;d gunned me when you had a chance,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221; Houck spat at him. &#8220;Too late now. Well,
what&#8217;s it to be?&#8221; Again he applied the torture.</p>
<p>The boy begged, pleaded, then surrendered. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
stand it! I&#8217;ll do anything you say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know yore li&#8217;l&#8217; piece. Speak it right up,&#8221;
ordered the cattleman.</p>
<p>Bob said it, with his eyes on the ground, feeling and
looking like a whipped cur. &#8220;You better go with him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
June. I&mdash;I&#8217;m no good.&#8221; A sob choked him. He buried
his face in his hands.</p>
<p>Houck laughed harshly. &#8220;You hear him, June.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a small dead voice June asked a question. &#8220;Do
you mean that, Bob&mdash;that I&#8217;m to go with him&mdash;that
you give me up?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her husband nodded, without looking up.</p>
<p>No man can sacrifice his mate to save his own hide
and still hold her respect. June looked at him in a nausea
of sick scorn. She turned from him, wasting no more
words.</p>
<p>She and Houck vanished into the gathering darkness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>IN THE IMAGE OF GOD</h3>
</div>

<p>Houck&#8217;s jeering laugh of triumph came back to the
humiliated boy. He noticed for the first time that two
or three men were watching him from the door of the
saloon. Ashamed to the depths of his being, he hung his
head dejectedly. All his life he would be a marked figure
because Jake had stamped the manhood out of him, had
walked off with his bride of an hour.</p>
<p>In the country of the open spaces a man must have
sand. Courage is the basis upon which the other virtues
are built, the fundamental upon which he is most searchingly
judged. Let a man tell the truth, stick to his pal,
and fight when trouble is forced on him, and he will do
to ride the river with, in the phrase of the plains.</p>
<p>Bob had lost June. She would, of course, never look
at him again. To have failed her so miserably cut deep
into his pride and self-respect. With her he had lost,
too, the esteem of all those who lived within a radius of
fifty miles. For the story would go out to every ranch
and cow-camp. Worst of all he had blown out the dynamic
spark within himself that is the source of life and
hope.</p>
<p>He did not deceive himself. Houck had said he was
going to take June to her father. But he had said it with
a cynical sneer on his lips. For the girl to be Jake&#8217;s wife
would have been bad enough, but to be his victim without
the protection of legality would be infinitely worse.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
And that was the lot to which June was destined. She
had fought, but she could fight no longer.</p>
<p>Fate had played her a scurvy trick in the man she had
chosen. Another husband&mdash;Dud Hollister, for instance&mdash;would
have battled it out for her to a finish, till he
had been beaten so badly he could no longer crawl to his
feet. If Bob had done that, even though he had been
hopelessly overmatched, he would have broken Houck&#8217;s
power over June. All the wild, brave spirit of her would
have gone out to her husband in a rush of feeling. The
battle would have been won for them both. The thing
that had stung her pride and crushed her spirit was that
he had not struck a blow for her. His cowardice had
driven her to Jake Houck&#8217;s arms because there was no
other place for her to go.</p>
<p>Their adventure had ended in tragedy both for her
and for him. Bob sank down on a dry-goods box and
put his twitching face in his hands. He had flung away
both his own chance for happiness and hers. So far as
he was concerned he was done for. He could never live
down the horrible thing he had done.</p>
<p>He had been rather a frail youth, with very little
confidence in himself. Above all else he had always admired
strength and courage, the qualities in which he
was most lacking. He had lived on the defensive, oppressed
by a subconscious sense of inferiority. His actions
had been conditioned by fear. Life at the charitable
institution where he had been sent as a small child
fostered this depression of the ego and its subjection to
external circumstances. The manager of the home ruled
by the rod. Bob had always lived in a sick dread of it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
Only within the past few months had he begun to come
into his own, a heritage of health and happiness.</p>
<p>Dud Hollister came to him out of Dolan&#8217;s saloon.
&#8220;Say, fellow, where&#8217;s my gun?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Bob looked up. &#8220;He&mdash;took it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I lose my six-shooter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix it with you when I get the money to buy
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy looked so haggard, his face so filled with
despair, that Dud was touched in spite of himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why in Mexico didn&#8217;t you give that bird a pill outa
the gun?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m&mdash;no good,&#8221; Bob wailed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said it right that time. I&#8217;ll be doggoned if I
ever saw such a thing as a fellow lettin&#8217; another guy
walk off with his wife&mdash;when he ain&#8217;t been married
hardly two hours yet. Say, what&#8217;s the matter with you
anyhow? Why didn&#8217;t you take a fall outa him? All he
could &#8217;a&#8217; done was beat you to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He hurt me,&#8221; Bob confessed miserably. &#8220;I&mdash;was
afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurt you? Great jumpin&#8217; Jupiter. Say, fellows,
listen to Miss&mdash;Miss Roberta here. He hurt him, so he
quit on the job&mdash;this guy here did. I never heard the
beat o&#8217; that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll borrow one of yore friends&#8217; guns an&#8217; blow
my brains out you&#8217;ll do me a favor,&#8221; the harried youth
told Hollister in a low voice.</p>
<p>Hollister looked at him searchingly. &#8220;I might, at
that,&#8221; agreed the puncher. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not doin&#8217; that
kind of favor to-day. I&#8217;ll give you a piece of advice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
This ain&#8217;t no country for you. Hop a train for Boston,
Mass., or one o&#8217; them places where you can take yore
troubles to a fellow with a blue coat. Tha&#8217;s where you
belong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Up the street rolled Blister Haines, in time to hear
the cowpuncher&#8217;s suggestion. Already the news had
reached the justice of what had taken place. He was
one of those amiable busybodies who take care of other
people&#8217;s troubles for them. Sometimes his efforts came
to grief and sometimes they did not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hit the trail, you lads,&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;I&#8217;ll l-look out
for this b-business. The exc-c-citement&#8217;s all over anyhow.
Drift.&#8221;</p>
<p>The range-riders disappeared. At best the situation
was an embarrassing one. It is not pleasant to be in the
company of one who has just shown himself a poltroon
and is acutely aware of it.</p>
<p>Blister took Dillon into his office. He lowered himself
into the biggest chair carefully, rolled a cigarette, and lit
up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me about it,&#8221; he ordered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; to tell.&#8221; Bob leaned against the table and
looked drearily at the floor. The world had come to an
end for him. That was all. &#8220;He showed up an&#8217; took
June from me&mdash;made me tell her to go along with
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did he do that? Did he cover you with a gun?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I had the gun&mdash;till he took it from me.&#8221; He
gave the explanation he had used twice already within
the hour. &#8220;I&#8217;m no good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blister heaved himself up from the chair and waddled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
closer to the boy. He shook a fat forefinger in his face.
He glared at him fiercely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, where you from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Austin, Texas, when I was a kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, damn you, Texas man, I w-want to t-tell you
right now that you&#8217;re talkin&#8217; blasphemy when you say
you&#8217;re n-no good. The good Lord made you, didn&#8217;t
He? D-d&#8217; you reckon I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to let you stand up there
an&#8217; claim He did a pore job? No, sir. Trouble with you
is you go an&#8217; bury yore talent instead of w-whalin&#8217; the
stuffin&#8217; outa that Jake Houck fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I was dead,&#8221; Bob groaned, drooping in every
line of his figure. &#8220;I wish I&#8217;d never been born.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blasphemy number two. Didn&#8217;t He make you in
His image? What right you got wishin&#8217; He hadn&#8217;t
created you? Why, you pore w-worm, you&#8217;re only a
mite lower than the angels an&#8217; yore red haid&#8217;s covered
with glory.&#8221; Blister&#8217;s whisper of a voice took unexpectedly
a sharp edge. &#8220;Snap it up! That red haid o&#8217;
yours. Hear me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s head came up as though a spring had been
released.</p>
<p>&#8220;B-better. K-keep it up where it belongs. Now, then,
w-what are you aimin&#8217; for to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob shook his head. &#8220;Get outa this country, like
Hollister said. Find a hole somewheres an&#8217; pull it in
after me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. Not none. You&#8217;re gonna stay right here&mdash;in
the country round Bear Cat&mdash;where every last man,
woman, an&#8217; k-kid will know how you ate d-dirt when
Houck told you to.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t do that,&#8221; the boy pleaded. &#8220;Why, I
wouldn&#8217;t have a chance. I&#8217;d know what they were
sayin&#8217; all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure you&#8217;d know it. Tha&#8217;s the price you g-gotta
pay for g-grovelin&#8217;. Don&#8217;t you see yore only chance is to
go out an&#8217; make good before the folks who know how
you&#8217;ve acted? Sneak off an&#8217; keep still about what you
did, amongst s-strangers, an&#8217; where do you get off?
You know all yore life you&#8217;re only a worm. The best
you can be is a bluff. You&#8217;d be d-duckin&#8217; outa makin&#8217;
the fight you&#8217;ve gotta make. That don&#8217;t get you anywhere
a-tall. No, sir. Go out an&#8217; reverse the verdict of
the court. Make good, right amongst the people who&#8217;re
keepin&#8217; tabs on yore record. You can do it, if you
c-clamp yore j-jaw an&#8217; remember that yore red haid is
c-covered with g-glory an&#8217; you been given dominion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;S-snap it up!&#8221; squeaked Blister.</p>
<p>The red head came up again with a jerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll I do? Where&#8217;ll I find work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out on the range. At the K Bar T, or the Keystone,
or the Slash Lazy D. It don&#8217;t m-matter where.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmp! Learn, can&#8217;t you? Dud Hollister an&#8217; Tom
Reeves wasn&#8217;t neither one of them born on a bronc&#8217;s
back. They climbed up there. So can you. You&#8217;ll take
the dust forty times. You&#8217;ll get yore bones busted an&#8217;
yore red haid cut open. But if you got the guts to stick,
you&#8217;ll be ridin&#8217; &#8217;em slick one o&#8217; these here days. An&#8217;
you&#8217;ll come out a m-man.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>A faint glow began to stir in the boy&#8217;s heart. Was
there really a chance for him to reverse the verdict?
Could he still turn over a leaf and make another start?</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have one heluva time for a while,&#8221; Blister
prophesied. &#8220;Take &#8217;em by an&#8217; large an&#8217; these lads
chasin&#8217; cows&#8217; tails are the salt o&#8217; the earth. They&#8217;ll go
farther with you an&#8217; stick longer than anybody else you
ever met up with. Once they know you an&#8217; like you.
But they&#8217;ll be right offish with you for a while. Kinda
polite an&#8217; distant, I expect. S-some overbearin&#8217; g-guy
will start runnin&#8217; on you, knowin&#8217; it&#8217;ll be safe. It&#8217;ll be
up to you to m-make it mighty onsafe for him. Go
through to a finish that once an&#8217; the boys will begin
sizin&#8217; you up an&#8217; wonderin&#8217; about you. Those show-me
lads will have to get evidence about &#8217;steen times before
they&#8217;ll believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never be able to stick it. I&#8217;m such a&mdash;so
timid,&#8221; Dillon groaned.</p>
<p>The justice bristled. &#8220;H-hell&#8217;s bells! What&#8217;s ailin&#8217;
you, Texas man? I tell you that you&#8217;re made in His
image. Bite on that thought hard whenever you&#8217;re up
against it an&#8217; want to hide yorese&#8217;f in a hole. Every time
you get too s-scared to play yore hand out, you&#8217;re playin&#8217;
it low down on yore C-creator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob came to another phase of the situation. &#8220;What
about&mdash;June?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what about her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s gone with Houck. He&#8217;ll not take her home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217; you m-mean not take her home? Where&#8217;ll
he take her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m responsible for her. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
brought her here. He means to&mdash;to make her live with
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep her by force&mdash;that what you&#8217;re drivin&#8217; at?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No-o. Not exactly. He&#8217;s got a hold over her father
somehow. She&#8217;s worn out fightin&#8217; him. When she ran
away with me she played her last card. She&#8217;ll have to
give up now. He&#8217;s so big an&#8217; strong, such a bulldog for
gettin&#8217; his way, that she can&#8217;t hold him off. June ain&#8217;t
seventeen yet. She&#8217;s gettin&#8217; a mighty rotten deal, looks
like. First off, livin&#8217; alone the way she an&#8217; Tolliver do,
then Houck, then me, an&#8217; finally Houck again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll notify Tolliver how things are,&#8221; Blister said.
&#8220;Get word to him right away. We&#8217;ll have to take a lead
from him about June.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinkin&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Onload it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Gillespie was so kind to her. Maybe she could
talk to June an&#8217; take her at the hotel&mdash;if June an&#8217;
Houck haven&#8217;t gone yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said something then, boy. I&#8217;ll see Mollie right
away. She&#8217;ll sure fix it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were too late. The wrangler at Kilburn&#8217;s corral
had already seen Houck hitch up and drive away with
June, they presently learned.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>JUNE PRAYS</h3>
</div>

<p>When June turned away from her husband of an hour
she abandoned hope. She had been like a child lost in the
forest. A gleam of light from a window had cheered her
for a moment, but it had flickered out and left her in the
darkness.</p>
<p>In one sense June was innocent as an infant. She
knew nothing of feminine blandishments, of the coquetry
which has become so effective a weapon in the
hands of modern woman when she is not hampered by
scruples. But she had lived too close to nature not to be
aware of carnal appetite.</p>
<p>It is a characteristic of frontier life that one learns to
face facts. June looked at them now, clear-eyed, despair
in her heart. As she walked beside Jake to the
corral, as she waited for him to hitch up the broncos,
as she rode beside him silently through the gathering
night, the girl&#8217;s mind dwelt on that future which was
closing in on her like prison walls.</p>
<p>Not for an instant did she deceive herself. Houck did
not mean to take her to Tolliver. She knew that his conscience
would acquit him of blame for what he meant to
do. He had given her a chance to marry him, and she
had made it impossible. That was not his fault. He
would take her to Brown&#8217;s Park with him when he returned.
Probably they were on the way there now.</p>
<p>After the plunging broncos had steadied down, Jake
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
spoke. &#8220;You&#8217;re well shet of him. He&#8217;s no good, like he
said himself. A man&#8217;s got to have guts. You&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; had
to wear the breeches, June.&#8221; The long whip curved out
inexorably. &#8220;Git over there, Buckskin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Houck drove like a master. After one wild bolt the
dancing ponies had sensed that a strong hand was at
the reins. They accepted the fact placidly. June
watched his handling of the lines sullenly, a dull resentment
and horror in her heart. He would subdue her as
easily as he had the half-broken colts, sometimes bullying,
sometimes mocking, sometimes making love to her
with barbaric ardor. There were times when his strength
and ruthlessness had fascinated June, but just now she
felt only horror weighted by a dull, dead despair.</p>
<p>No use to fight longer. In a world filled with Jake
Houck there was no free will. She was helpless as a wolf
in a trap.</p>
<p>They drove through a country of sagebrush hills.
The moon came out and carpeted the slopes with silver
lace. Deep within June was a born love of beauty as it
found expression in this land of the Rockies. But to-night
she did not taste the scent of the sage or see the
veil of mist that had transformed the draws magically
to fairy dells.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where you goin&#8217;?&#8221; she asked at last. &#8220;You said
you&#8217;d take me to Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed, slipped a strong arm round her shoulders,
and drew her closer. &#8220;Found yore tongue at last, June
girl, eh? We&#8217;re going home&mdash;to my place up in Brown&#8217;s
Park.&#8221;</p>
<p>She made a perfunctory protest. It was, she knew,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
quite useless, and her heart was not in it. No words she
used, no appeal she could make, would touch this man
or change his intentions.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got no right to take me there. I&#8217;m not yore
slave. I want to go to Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tha&#8217;s right,&#8221; he mocked. &#8220;I&#8217;m <i>yore</i> slave, June.
What&#8217;s the use of fighting? I&#8217;m so set on you that one
way or another I&#8217;m bound to have you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She bit her lip, to keep from weeping. In the silvery
night, alone with him, miles from any other human being,
she felt woefully helpless and forlorn. The years
slipped away. She was a little child, and her heart was
wailing for the mother whose body lay on the hillside
near the deserted cabin in Brown&#8217;s Park. What could
she do? How could she save herself from the evil
shadow that would blot the sunshine from her life?</p>
<p>Somewhere, in that night of stars and scudding
clouds, was God, she thought. He could save her if He
would. But would He? Miracles did not happen nowadays.
And why would He bother about her? She was
such a trifle in the great scheme of things, only a poor
ragged girl from the back country, the daughter of a
convict, poor hill trash, as she had once heard a woman
at Glenwood whisper. She was not of any account.</p>
<p>Yet prayers welled out in soundless sobs from a panic-stricken
heart. &#8220;O God, I&#8217;m only a li&#8217;l&#8217; girl, an&#8217; I
growed up without a mother. I&#8217;m right mean an&#8217; sulky,
but if you&#8217;ll save me this time from Jake Houck, I&#8217;ll
make out to say my prayers regular an&#8217; get religion first
chance comes along,&#8221; she explained and promised, her
small white face lifted to the vault where the God she
knew about lived.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>Drifts floated across the sky blown by currents from
the northwest. They came in billows, one on top of another,
till they had obscured most of the stars. The
moon went into eclipse, reappeared, vanished behind
the storm scud, and showed again.</p>
<p>The climate of the Rockies, year in, year out, is the
most stimulating on earth. Its summer breezes fill the
lungs with wine. Its autumns are incomparable, a
golden glow in which valley and hill bask lazily. Its
winters are warm with sunshine and cold with the crisp
crackle of frost. Its springs&mdash;they might be worse.
Any Coloradoan will admit the climate is superlative.
But there is one slight rift in the lute, hardly to be mentioned
as a discord in the universal harmony. Sudden
weather changes do occur. A shining summer sun vanishes
and in a twinkling of an eye the wind is whistling
snell.</p>
<p>Now one of these swept over the Rio Blanco Valley.
The clouds thickened, the air grew chill. The thermometer
was falling fast.</p>
<p>Houck swung the team up from the valley road to the
mesa. Along this they traveled, close to the sage-covered
foothills. At a point where a draw dipped down to
the road, Houck pulled up and dismounted. A gate
made of three strands of barbed wire and two poles
barred the wagon trail. For already the nester was
fencing the open range.</p>
<p>As Houck moved forward to the gate the moon disappeared
back of the banked clouds. June&#8217;s eye swept
the landscape and brightened. The sage and the brush
were very thick here. A grove of close-packed quaking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
asps filled the draw. She glanced at Jake. He was busy
wrestling with the loop of wire that fastened the gate.</p>
<p>God helps those that help themselves, June remembered.
She put down the lines Houck had handed her,
stepped softly from the buckboard, and slipped into the
quaking asps.</p>
<p>A moment later she heard Jake&#8217;s startled oath. It
was certain that he would plunge into the thicket of
saplings in pursuit. She crept to one side of the draw
and crouched low.</p>
<p>He did not at once dive in. From where she lay hidden,
June could hear the sound of his footsteps as he
moved to and fro.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you try to make a fool of Jake Houck, girl,&#8221;
he called to her angrily. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t standin&#8217; for any nonsense
now. We got to be movin&#8217; right along. Come outa
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her heart was thumping so that she was afraid he
might hear it. She held herself tense, not daring to move
a finger lest she make a rustling of leaves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear me, June! Git a move on you. If you
don&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221; He broke off, with another oath. &#8220;I&#8217;ll mark
yore back for you sure enough with my whip when I
find you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She heard him crashing into the thicket. He passed
her not ten feet away, so close that she made out the
vague lines of his big body. A few paces farther he
stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you, girl. You ain&#8217;t foolin&#8217; me any. Tell you
what I&#8217;ll do. You come right along back to the buckboard
an&#8217; I&#8217;ll let you off the lickin&#8217; this time.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>She trembled, violently. It seemed that he did see her,
for he moved a step or two in her direction. Then he
stopped, to curse, and the rage that leaped into the
heavy voice betrayed the bluff.</p>
<p>Evidently he made up his mind that she was higher
up the draw. He went thrashing up the arroyo, ploughing
through the young aspens with a great crackle of
breaking branches.</p>
<p>June took advantage of this to creep up the side of
the draw and out of the grove. The sage offered poorer
cover in which to hide, but her knowledge of Houck told
her that he would not readily give up the idea that she
was in the asps. He was a one-idea man, obstinate even
to pigheadedness. So long as there was a chance she
might be in the grove he would not stop searching
there. He would reason that the draw was so close to
the buckboard she must have slipped into it. Once
there, she would stay because in it she could lie concealed.</p>
<p>Her knowledge of the habits of wild animals served
June well now. The first instinct was to get back to the
road and run down it at full speed, taking to the brush
only when she heard the pursuit. But this would not do.
The sage here was much heavier and thicker than it was
nearer Bear Cat. She would find a place to hide in it till
he left to drive back and cut her off from town. There
was one wild moment when she thought of slipping
down to the buckboard and trying to escape in it. June
gave this up because she would have to back it along the
narrow road for fifteen or twenty yards before she could
find a place to turn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>On hands and knees she wound deeper into the sage,
always moving toward the rim-rock at the top of the
hill. She was still perilously close to Houck. His muffled
oaths, the thrashing of the bushes, the threats and
promises he stopped occasionally to make; all of these
came clear to her in spite of the whistling wind.</p>
<p>It had come on to rain mistily. June was glad of that.
She would have welcomed a heavy downpour out of a
black night. The rim-rock was close above. She edged
along it till she came to a scar where the sandstone had
broken off and scorched a path down the slope. Into the
hollow formed by two boulders resting against each
other she crawled.</p>
<p>For hours she heard Jake moving about, first among
the aspens and later on the sage hill. The savage oaths
that reached her now and again were evidence enough
that the fellow was in a vile temper. If he should find
her now, she felt sure he would carry out his vow as to
the horsewhip.</p>
<p>The night was cold. June shivered where she lay
close to the ground. The rain beat in uncomfortably.
But she did not move till Houck drove away.</p>
<p>Even then she descended to the road cautiously. He
might have laid a trap for her by returning on foot in the
darkness. But she had to take a chance. What she
meant to do was clear in her mind. It would require all
her wits and strength to get safely back to town.</p>
<p>She plodded along the road for perhaps a mile, then
swung down from the mesa to the river. The ford where
Jake had driven across was farther down, but she could
not risk the crossing. Very likely he was lying in wait
there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>June took off her brogans and tied them round her
neck. She would have undressed, but she was afraid
of losing the clothes while in the stream.</p>
<p>It was dark. She did not know the river, how deep it
was or how strong the current. As she waded slowly in,
her courage began to fail. She might never reach the
other shore. The black night and the rain made it seem
very far away.</p>
<p>She stopped, thigh deep, to breathe another prayer
to the far-away God of her imagination, who sat on a
throne in the skies, an arbitrary emperor of the universe.
He had helped her once to-night. Maybe He would
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;O God, don&#8217;t please lemme drown,&#8221; she said aloud,
in order to be quite sure her petition would be heard.</p>
<p>Deeper into the current she moved. The water
reached her waist. Presently its sweep lifted her from
the bottom. She threw herself forward and began to
swim. It did not seem to her that she was making any
headway. The heavy skirts dragged down her feet and
obstructed free movement of them. Not an expert
swimmer, she was soon weary. Weights pulled at the
arms as they swept back the water in the breast-stroke.
It flashed through her mind that she could not last
much longer. Almost at the same instant she discovered
the bank. Her feet touched bottom. She shuffled
heavily through the shallows and sank down on the
shore completely exhausted.</p>
<p>Later, it was in June&#8217;s mind that she must have been
unconscious. When she took note of her surroundings
she was lying on a dry pebbly wash which the stream
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
probably covered in high water. Snowflakes fell on
her cheek and melted there. She rose, stiff and shivering.
In crossing the river the brogans had washed from her
neck. She moved forward in her stocking feet. For a
time she followed the Rio Blanco, then struck abruptly
to the right through the sagebrush and made a wide circuit.</p>
<p>It was definitely snowing now and the air was colder.
June&#8217;s feet were bleeding, though she picked a way in
the grama-grass and the tumbleweed to save them as
much as possible. Once she stepped into a badger hole
covered with long buffalo grass and strained a tendon.</p>
<p>She had plenty of pluck. The hardships of the frontier
had instilled into her endurance. Though she had
pitied herself when she was riding beside Jake Houck
to moral disaster, she did not waste any now because
she was limping painfully through the snow with the
clothes freezing on her body. She had learned to stand
the gaff, in the phrase of the old bullwhacker who had
brought her down from Rawlins. It was a part of her
code that physical pain and discomfort must be trodden
under foot and disregarded.</p>
<p>A long détour brought her back to the river. She
plodded on through the storm, her leg paining at every
step. She was chilled to the marrow and very tired.
But she clamped her small strong teeth and kept going.</p>
<p>The temptation to give up and lie down assailed her.
She fought against it, shuffling forward, stumbling as
her dragging feet caught in the snow. She must be near
Bear Cat now. Surely it could not be far away. If it
was not very close, she knew she was beaten.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>After what seemed an eternity of travel a light
gleamed through the snow. She saw another&mdash;a
third.</p>
<p>She zigzagged down the road like a drunkard.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>MOLLIE TAKES CHARGE</h3>
</div>

<p>Bear Cat was a cow-town, still in its frankest, most
exuberant youth. Big cattle outfits had settled on the
river and ran stock almost to the Utah line. Every
night the saloons and gambling-houses were filled with
punchers from the Diamond K, the Cross Bar J, the
Half Circle Dot, or any one of a dozen other brands up
or down the Rio Blanco. They came from Williams&#8217;s
Fork, Squaw, Salt, Beaver, or Piney Creeks. And usually
they came the last mile or two on the dead run,
eager to slake a thirst as urgent as their high spirits.</p>
<p>They were young fellows most of them, just out of
their boyhood, keen to spend their money and have a
good time when off duty. Always they made straight
for Dolan&#8217;s or the Bear Cat House. First they downed
a drink or two, then they washed off the dust of travel.
This done, each followed his own inclination. He gambled,
drank, or frolicked around, according to the desire
of the moment.</p>
<p>Dud Hollister and Tom Reeves, with Blister Haines
rolling between them, impartially sampled the goods at
Dolan&#8217;s and at Mollie Gillespie&#8217;s. They had tried their
hand at faro, with unfortunate results, and they had sat
in for a short session at a poker game where Dud had
put too much faith in a queen full.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure let my foot slip that time,&#8221; Dud admitted.
&#8220;I&#8217;d been playin&#8217; plumb outa luck. Couldn&#8217;t fill a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
hand, an&#8217; when I did, couldn&#8217;t get it to stand up. That
last queen looked like money from home. I reckon I
overplayed it,&#8221; he ruminated aloud, while he waited for
Mike Moran to give him another of the same.</p>
<p>Tom hooked his heel on the rail in front of the bar. &#8220;I
ain&#8217;t made up my mind yet that game was on the level.
That tinhorn who claimed he was from Cheyenne ce&#8217;tainly
had a mighty funny run o&#8217; luck. D&#8217; you notice
how his hands jes&#8217; topped ours? Kinda queer, I got to
thinkin&#8217;. He didn&#8217;t hold any more&#8217;n he had to for to
rake the chips in. I&#8217;d sorta like a look-see at the deck we
was playin&#8217; with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blister laughed wheezily. &#8220;You w-won&#8217;t get it.
N-never heard of a hold-up gettin&#8217; up a petition for better
street lights, did you? No, an&#8217; you n-never will.
An&#8217; you never n-noticed a guy who was aimin&#8217; to bushwhack
another from the brush go to clearin&#8217; off the sage
first. He ain&#8217;t l-lookin&#8217; for no open arguments on the
m-merits of his shootin&#8217;. Not none. Same with that
Cheyenne bird an&#8217; his stocky pal acrost the table.
They&#8217;re f-figurin&#8217; that dead decks tell no tales. The
one you played with is sure enough s-scattered every
which way all over the floor along with seve-real
others.&#8221; The fat justice of the peace murmured
&#8220;How!&#8221; and tilted his glass.</p>
<p>If Blister did not say &#8220;I told you so,&#8221; it was not because
he might not have done it fairly. He had made
one comment when Dud had proposed sitting in to the
game of draw.</p>
<p>&#8220;H-how much m-mazuma you got?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-five bucks left.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you s-stay outa that game you&#8217;ll earn t-twenty-five
bucks the quickest you ever did in yore life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Youth likes to buy its experience and not borrow it.
Dud knew now that Blister had been a wise prophet in
his generation.</p>
<p>The bar at Gillespie&#8217;s was at the front of the house.
In the rear were the faro and poker tables, the roulette
wheels, and the other conveniences for separating hurried
patrons from their money. The Bear Cat House
did its gambling strictly on the level, but there was the
usual percentage in favor of the proprietor.</p>
<p>Mollie was sitting in an armchair on a small raised
platform about halfway back. She kept a brisk and
business-like eye on proceedings. No puncher who had
gone broke, no tenderfoot out of luck, could go hungry
in Bear Cat if she knew it. The restaurant and the bar
were at their service just as though they had come off
the range with a pay-check intact. They could pay
when they had the money. No books were kept. Their
memories were the only ledgers. Few of these debts of
honor went unpaid in the end.</p>
<p>But Mollie, though tender-hearted, knew how to run
the place. Her brusque, curt manner suited Bear Cat.
She could be hail-fellow or hard as flint, depending on
circumstances. The patrons at Gillespie&#8217;s remembered
her sex and yet forgot it. They guarded their speech,
but they drank with her at the bar or sat across a poker
table from her on equal terms. She was a good sport
and could lose or win large sums imperturbably.</p>
<p>Below her now there floated past a tide of hot-blooded
youth eager to make the most of the few hours left before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
the dusty trails called. Most of these punchers
would go back penniless to another month or two of
hard and reckless riding. But they would go gayly, without
regret, the sunshine of irrepressible boyhood in their
hearts. The rattle of chips, the sound of laughter, the
murmur of conversation, the even voice of the croupier
at the roulette table, filled the hall.</p>
<p>Jim Larson, a cowman from down the river, sat on
the edge of the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Boot brand&#8217;s puttin&#8217; a thousand head in the
upper country this fall, Mollie. Looks to me like bad
business, but there&#8217;s a chance I&#8217;m wrong at that. My
bet is you can&#8217;t run cows there without winter feed.
There won&#8217;t many of &#8217;em rough through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some&#8217;ll drift down to the river,&#8221; Mollie said, her
preoccupied eyes on the stud table where a slight altercation
seemed to be under way. Her method of dealing
with quarrels was simple. The first rule was based on
one of Blister Haines&#8217;s paradoxes. &#8220;The best way to
settle trouble is not to have it.&#8221; She tried to stop difficulties
before they became acute. If this failed, she
walked between the angry youths and read the riot act
to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some will,&#8221; admitted Larson. &#8220;More of &#8217;em won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mollie rose, to step down from the platform. She did
not reach the stud table. A commotion at the front
door drew her attention. Mrs. Gillespie was a solid,
heavy-set woman, but she moved with an energy that
carried her swiftly. She reached the bar before any of
the men from the gambling-tables.</p>
<p>A girl was leaning weakly against the door-jamb.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
Hat and shoes were gone. The hair was a great black
mop framing a small face white to the lips. The stocking
soles were worn through. When one foot shifted
to get a better purchase for support, a bloodstained
track was left on the floor. The short dress was frozen
stiff.</p>
<p>The dark, haunted eyes moved uncertainly round the
circle of faces staring at her. The lips opened and made
the motions of speech, but no sound came from them.
Without any warning the girl collapsed.</p>
<p>Dud Hollister&#8217;s arm was under the ice-coated head in
an instant. He looked up at Mollie Gillespie, who had
been only a fraction of a second behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the li&#8217;l&#8217; bride,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>She nodded. &#8220;Brandy an&#8217; water, Mike. Quick!
She&#8217;s only fainted. Head not so high, Dud. Tha&#8217;s right.
We&#8217;ll get a few drops of this between her teeth....
She&#8217;s comin&#8217; to.&#8221;</p>
<p>June opened her eyes and looked at Mollie. Presently
she looked round and a slow wonder grew in them.
&#8220;Where am I?&#8221; she murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re at the hotel&mdash;where you&#8217;ll be looked after
right, dearie.&#8221; Mrs. Gillespie looked up. &#8220;Some one
get Doc Tuckerman. An&#8217; you, Tom, hustle Peggie and
Chung Lung outa their beds if they&#8217;re not up. There&#8217;s
a fire in my room. Tell her to take the blankets from
the bed an&#8217; warm &#8217;em. Tell Chung to heat several kettles
o&#8217; water fast as he can. Dud, you come along an&#8217;
carry her to the stove in the lobby. The rest o&#8217; you&#8217;ll
stay right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mollie did not ask any questions or seek explanation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
That could wait. The child had been through a
terrible experience and must be looked after first.</p>
<p>From the lobby Dud presently carried June into the
bedroom and departed. A roaring fire was in the stove.
Blankets and a flannel nightgown were hanging over
the backs of chairs to warm. With the help of the chambermaid
Peggie, the landlady stripped from the girl the
frozen dress and the wet underclothes. Over the thin,
shivering body she slipped the nightgown, then tucked
her up in the blankets. As soon as Chung brought the
hot-water jugs she put one at June&#8217;s feet and another
close to the stomach where the cold hands could rest
upon it.</p>
<p>June was still shaking as though she never would
get warm. A faint mist of tears obscured her sight.
&#8220;Y-you&#8217;re awful good to me,&#8221; she whispered, teeth
chattering.</p>
<p>The doctor approved of what had been done. He left
medicine for the patient. &#8220;Be back in five minutes,&#8221; he
told Mrs. Gillespie outside the room. &#8220;Want some stuff
I&#8217;ve got at the office. Think I&#8217;ll stay for a few hours and
see how the case develops. Afraid she&#8217;s in for a bad
spell of pneumonia.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not leave the sick-room after his return until
morning. Mollie stayed there, too. It was nearly one
o&#8217;clock when Blister Haines knocked gently at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s the li&#8217;l&#8217; lady?&#8221; he asked in his high falsetto,
after Mollie had walked down the passage with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a mighty sick girl. Pneumonia, likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell doc not to let her die. If he needs another doctor
some of us&#8217;ll h-hustle over to Glenwood an&#8217; g-get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
one. Say, Mrs. Gillespie, I reckon there&#8217;s gonna be
trouble in town to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said nothing, but her blue eyes questioned him.</p>
<p>Blister&#8217;s next sentence sent her moving toward the
saloon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>BEAR CAT ASKS QUESTIONS</h3>
</div>

<p>A man bow-legged into Gillespie&#8217;s and went straight to
the bar. &#8220;Gimme a drink&mdash;something damned hot,&#8221;
he growled.</p>
<p>He was a big, broad-shouldered fellow, hook-nosed,
with cold eyes set close. Hair and eyebrows were matted
with ice and a coat of sleet covered his clothes. Judging
from voice and manner, he was in a vile humor.</p>
<p>A young fellow standing near was leaning with his
back against the bar, elbows resting on it. One heel was
hooked casually over the rail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything been seen of a strange girl in town to-night?&#8221;
the newcomer asked. &#8220;She ain&#8217;t right in her
head an&#8217; I was takin&#8217; her to her dad&#8217;s place when she
slipped away. I&#8217;m worried about her, out in this storm.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cowpuncher looked at him coldly, eye to eye.
&#8220;I&#8217;d say you got a license to be. If she&#8217;s lost out to-night
she&#8217;s liable to be frozen to death before mo&#8217;ning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Houck, and his lids narrowed. What
did this young fellow mean? There was something
about his manner both strange and challenging. If he
was looking for a fight, Houck knew just where he could
be accommodated.</p>
<p>&#8220;In which case&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The puncher stopped significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;In which case&mdash;?&#8221; Houck prompted.</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;it might be unlucky for the guy that took her out
an&#8217; lost her.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s yore name, fellow?&#8221; Jake demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fellow, my name&#8217;s Dud Hollister,&#8221; promptly answered
the other. &#8220;D&#8217;you like it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much. Neither it nor you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Houck turned insolently back to the bar for his drink.</p>
<p>Mike was stirring into the glass of liquor cayenne
pepper which he was shaking from a paper. He was
using as a mixer the barrel of a forty-five.</p>
<p>The salient jaw of Houck jutted out. &#8220;What monkey
trick are you tryin&#8217; to play on me?&#8221; he asked angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wanted it hot,&#8221; Mike replied, and the bartender&#8217;s
gaze too was cold and level.</p>
<p>It seemed to the former rustler that here was a second
man ready to fasten a quarrel on him. What was the
matter with these fellows anyhow?</p>
<p>Another puncher ranged himself beside Hollister.
&#8220;Who did this bird claim he was, Dud?&#8221; he asked out
loud, offensively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t say. Took that li&#8217;l&#8217; bride out in this storm
an&#8217; left her there. Expect he&#8217;ll be right popular in Bear
Cat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Houck smothered his rage. This was too serious to
be settled by an explosion of anger and an appeal to
arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you she hid whilst I was openin&#8217; a gate. I been
lookin&#8217; for her six hours. Thought maybe she&#8217;d come to
town. My idee is to organize a search party an&#8217; go out
after her. Quick as we can slap saddles on broncs an&#8217; hit
the trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fragments of the facts had drifted out to the boys
from the sick-room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>Dud tried an experiment. &#8220;Where&#8217;ll we hunt for
her&mdash;up toward Piceance?&#8221;</p>
<p>Houck deliberated before answering. If he were to tell
the truth&mdash;that she had escaped from him in the hills
nine miles down the river&mdash;these men would know he
had been lying when he said he was taking June to her
father. If he let the search party head toward Piceance,
there would be no chance for it to save the girl. The
man was no coward. To his credit, he told the truth.</p>
<p>A half-circle of hostile faces hemmed him in, for the
word had spread that this was the man who had carried
off June Tolliver. He was the focus of a dozen pairs of
eyes. Among the cattlemen of the Old West you will
still look into many such eyes, but never among city
dwellers will you find them. Blue they are for the most
part or gray-blue, level, direct, unfearing; quiet and
steady as steel, flinging no flags of flurry, tremendously
sure of themselves. They can be very likable eyes,
frank and kind, with innumerable little lines of humor
radiating from the corners; or they can be stern and
chill as the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>Jake Houck found in them no gentleness. They
judged him, inexorably, while he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where was you takin&#8217; her?&#8221; asked Larson, of the
Wagon Rod outfit.</p>
<p>In spite of his boldness, of the dominating imperiousness
by means of which he had been used to ride roughshod
over lesser men, Houck felt a chill sensation at his
heart. They were too quiet&mdash;too quiet by half.</p>
<p>&#8220;We was to have been married to-day,&#8221; he said surlily.
&#8220;This Dillon boy got her to run off with him. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
was no good. I rode hell-for-leather into town to head
&#8217;em off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blister brought him back to the question of the moment.
&#8220;An&#8217; you were t-takin&#8217; her&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Brown&#8217;s Park.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forcin&#8217; her to go. Was that it?&#8221; Hollister broke in.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. She went of her own accord.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Asked you to take her there, mebbe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None o&#8217; yore damn business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How old is she, Mr. Houck?&#8221; Larson questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do. Sixteen coming Christmas,&#8221; said Dud. &#8220;Dillon
told me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; how old are you, Mr. Houck?&#8221; the quiet, even
voice of the owner of the Wagon Rod pursued.</p>
<p>&#8220;I d&#8217;no as that&#8217;s got anything to do with it, but I&#8217;m
forty-three,&#8221; Jake retorted defiantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You meant to live with her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I meant to treat her right,&#8221; was the sullen reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;But livin&#8217; with her, an&#8217; her another man&#8217;s wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. That fake marriage with Dillon don&#8217;t go.
She was promised to me.&#8221; He broke out suddenly in
anger: &#8220;What&#8217;s eatin&#8217; you all? Why don&#8217;t you go out
an&#8217; help me find the girl? These whatfors an&#8217; whyfors
can wait, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blister dropped a bomb. &#8220;She&#8217;s found.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Found!&#8221; Houck stared at the fat man. &#8220;Who found
her? Where? When?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coupla hours ago. Here in this r-room. Kinda
funny how she&#8217;d swim the river a night like this an&#8217;
walk eight-ten miles barefoot in the snow, all to get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
away from you, an&#8217; her goin&#8217; with you of her own accord.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t eight miles&mdash;more like six.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Call it six, then. Fact is, Mr. Houck, she was mighty
scared of you&mdash;in a panic of terror, I&#8217;d say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She had no call to be,&#8221; the Brown&#8217;s Park settler replied,
his voice heavy with repressed rage. &#8220;I&#8217;m tellin&#8217;
you she wasn&#8217;t right in her head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you was takin&#8217; advantage of that to make this
li&#8217;l&#8217; girl yore&mdash;to ruin her life for her,&#8221; Hollister flung
back.</p>
<p>In all his wild and turbulent lifetime Jake Houck had
never before been brought to task like this. He resented
the words, the manner, the quiet insistence of these
range men. An unease that was not quite fear, but was
very close to it, had made him hold his temper in leash.
Now the savage in him broke through.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a bunch of fool meddlers, an&#8217; I&#8217;m through
explainin&#8217;. You can go to hell &#8217;n&#8217; back for me,&#8221; he cried,
and followed with a string of crackling oaths.</p>
<p>The eyes of the punchers and cattlemen met one
another. No word was spoken, but the same message
passed back and forth a score of times.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect you don&#8217;t quite understand where you&#8217;re
at, Mr. Houck,&#8221; Larson said evenly. &#8220;This is mighty
serious business for you. We aim to give you a chance
to tell yore story complete before we take action.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Action?&#8221; repeated Houck, startled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re up against it for fair,&#8221; Reeves told him. &#8220;If
you figure on gettin&#8217; away with a thing like that in a
white man&#8217;s country you&#8217;ve sure got another guess
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
comin&#8217;. I don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;re from or who you
are, but I know where you&#8217;re going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;D-don&#8217;t push on the reins, Tom,&#8221; the justice said.
&#8220;We aim to be reasonable about this, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure we do.&#8221; Dud countered with one of Blister&#8217;s
own homely apothegms. &#8220;What&#8217;s the use of chewin&#8217;
tobacco if you spit out the juice? Go through, I say.
There&#8217;s a cottonwood back of the kitchen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re fixin&#8217; for to hang me?&#8221; Houck asked, his
throat and palate gone suddenly dry.</p>
<p>&#8220;You done guessed it first crack,&#8221; Tom nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet, boys,&#8221; protested Haines in his whispering
falsetto. &#8220;I reckon we&#8217;d ought to wait an&#8217; see how the
girl comes out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why had we?&#8221; demanded a squat puncher from the
Keystone. &#8220;What difference does it make? If ever any
one needed stringin&#8217; up, it&#8217;s the guy here. He&#8217;s worse
than Douglas or any other Injun ever was. Is it yore
notion we&#8217;d oughta sit around with our hands in our
pockets, Blister, while reptiles like this Houck make our
girls swim the river at night an&#8217; plough barefoot through
snowstorms? I ain&#8217;t that easy-dispositioned myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shorty&#8217;s sure whistlin&#8217;. Same here,&#8221; another chap-clad
rider chipped in.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blister dropped into the background inconspicuously
and vanished. He appeared to be in a minority of one,
not counting Houck, and he needed reënforcements.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll hear what Mr. Houck has to say before we
pass judgment,&#8221; Larson said.</p>
<p>But Houck, looking into the circle of grim faces that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
surrounded him, knew that he was condemned. Nothing
that he could say would make any difference. He
shrugged his heavy shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use? You&#8217;ve done made up yore minds.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noticed that the younger fellows were pressing
closer to him. Pretty soon they would disarm him. If
he was going to make a fight for his life, it had to be now.
His arm dropped to his side, close to the butt of the
revolver he carried.</p>
<p>He was too late. Hollister jumped for his wrist and at
the same time Mike flung himself across the bar and
garroted him. He struggled fiercely to free himself, but
was dragged down to the floor and pinioned. Before he
was lifted up his hands were tied behind him.</p>
<p>Unobserved, the front door of the barroom had
opened. An ice-coated figure was standing on the
threshold.</p>
<p>Houck laughed harshly. &#8220;Come right in, Tolliver.
You&#8217;ll be in time to take a hand in the show.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little trapper&#8217;s haggard eyes went round in perplexity.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; he asked mildly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No trouble a-tall,&#8221; answered the big prisoner hardily.
&#8220;The boys are hangin&#8217; me. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>HOUCK TAKES A RIDE</h3>
</div>

<p>Tolliver rubbed a hand uncertainly over a bristly
chin. &#8220;Why, what are they doin&#8217; that for, Jake?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you the Tolliver girl&#8217;s father?&#8221; asked Larson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we got bad news for you. She&#8217;s sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sick?&#8221; the trapper&#8217;s lips trembled.</p>
<p>&#8220;A mighty sick girl. This man here&mdash;this Houck, if
that&#8217;s what he calls himself&mdash;took her away from the
young fellow she&#8217;d married and started up to Brown&#8217;s
Park with her. Somehow she gave him the slip, swam
the river, an&#8217; came back to town barefoot through the
snow. Seems she lost her shoes while she was crossin&#8217;
the Blanco.&#8221;</p>
<p>The color washed away beneath the tan of the father&#8217;s
face. &#8220;Where&#8217;s she at?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&mdash;at the hotel. Mrs. Gillespie an&#8217; Doc Tuckerman
are lookin&#8217; after her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to go to her right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Dud, you know where the room is. Take Mr.
Tolliver there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pete.&#8221; Houck&#8217;s voice was hoarse, but no longer
defiant. In this little man, whom he had always bullied
and dominated, whose evil genius he had been, lay his
hope of life. &#8220;Pete, you ain&#8217;t a-going to leave yore old
pardner to be hanged.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tolliver looked bleakly at him. The spell this man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
had woven over him twenty-odd years ago was broken
forever. &#8220;I&#8217;m through with you, Jake,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t intendin&#8217; to lift a hand for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a finger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell these men howcome it I rode down to
Bear Cat after June?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Piceance Creek man&#8217;s jaw tightened. His small
eyes flashed hate. &#8220;Sure, I&#8217;ll tell &#8217;em that. About two-three
weeks ago Houck showed up at my place an&#8217;
stayed overnight. I knew him when we was both
younger, but I hadn&#8217;t seen him for a long time. He took
a notion to my June. She didn&#8217;t want to have a thing
to do with him, but he bullied her, same as he did me.
June she found out he knew something about me, an&#8217;
she was afraid to make him mad. I reckon finally he got
some kinda promise outa her. He had some business at
Meeker, an&#8217; he was comin&#8217; back to the ranch yestiddy.
Then he aimed to bring her here to get married.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was looking steadily at Houck. Pete had found at
last the courage to defy him. He could tell anything he
liked about the escape from Cañon City.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was away all day lookin&#8217; over my traps an&#8217; fixin&#8217;
them up. When I reached home I found two notes. I
got &#8217;em here somewheres.&#8221; Tolliver fumbled in his coat
pockets, but did not find them. &#8220;One was from June.
She said she was runnin&#8217; away to marry the Dillon boy.
The other was from Jake Houck. He&#8217;d got to the house
before I did, found her note to me, an&#8217; lit out after her.
Soon&#8217;s I could run up a horse I hit the trail too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Threw me down, eh, Pete?&#8221; Houck said bitterly.
&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s two can play at that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>Tolliver did not flinch. &#8220;Go to it, soon as you&#8217;ve a
mind to. I don&#8217;t owe you a thing except misery. You
wrecked my life. I suffered for you an&#8217; kept my mouth
padlocked. I was coyote enough to sit back an&#8217; let you
torment my li&#8217;l&#8217; girl because I was afraid for to have the
truth come out an&#8217; hurt her. I&#8217;d ought to have gone
after you with a forty-five. I&#8217;m through. They can&#8217;t
hang you any too soon to suit me. If they don&#8217;t&mdash;an&#8217;
if my June don&#8217;t get well&mdash;I&#8217;ll gun you sure as God
made li&#8217;l&#8217; apples.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned and walked out of the room with Dud Hollister.</p>
<p>In the passage they met Mollie Gillespie and Blister
Haines. The first words the landlady heard were from
Houck.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, I&#8217;ve got nothing to say. What&#8217;d be the use?
You&#8217;ve made up yore minds to go through with this
thing. A fool could see that. Far as Tolliver goes, I
reckon I&#8217;ll go it alone an&#8217; not do any beefin&#8217; about him.
He threw me down hard, but he was considerable
strung up about June. Wouldn&#8217;t do any good for me to
tell what I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit,&#8221; assented Reeves. &#8220;Might as well game
it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Houck&#8217;s hard, cold eye looked at him steadily. &#8220;Who
said anything about not gaming it out? If you&#8217;re expectin&#8217;
me to beg an&#8217; crawl you&#8217;ve got hold of the
wrong man. I&#8217;m a damned tough nut an&#8217; don&#8217;t you
forget it. Whenever you&#8217;re ready, gents.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the door Mrs. Gillespie spoke. &#8220;What&#8217;s all
this?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>She became at once the center of attention. The
punchers grouped around Houck were taken by surprise.
They were disconcerted by this unexpected addition to
the party. For though Mrs. Gillespie led an irregular
life, no woman on the river was so widely loved as she.
The mother of Bear Cat, the boys called her. They
could instance a hundred examples of the goodness of
her heart. She never tired of waiting on the sick, of giving
to those who were needy. It was more than possible
she would not approve the summary vengeance about
to be executed upon the Brown&#8217;s Park man.</p>
<p>The prisoner was the first to answer. &#8220;Just in time,
ma&#8217;am. The boys are stagin&#8217; an entertainment. They&#8217;re
fixin&#8217; to hang me. If you&#8217;ll accept an invite from the
hangee I&#8217;ll be glad to have you stay an&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hanging him? What for? What&#8217;s he done?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Reeves found his voice. &#8220;He&#8217;s the fellow done
dirt to the li&#8217;l&#8217; Tolliver girl, ma&#8217;am. We&#8217;ve had a
kinda trial an&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fiddlesticks!&#8221; interrupted the woman. She swept
the group with an appraising eye. &#8220;I&#8217;m surprised to
see you in this, Larson. Thought you had more sense.
Nobody would expect anything better of these flyaway
boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>The owner of the Wagon Rod brand attempted defense,
a little sheepishly. &#8220;What would you want us to
do, Mollie? This fellow treated the girl outrageous.
She&#8217;s liable to die because&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Die! Nonsense! She&#8217;s not going to die any more
than this Houck is.&#8221; She looked the Brown&#8217;s Park man
over contemptuously with chill, steady eyes. &#8220;He&#8217;s a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
bad egg. It wouldn&#8217;t hurt my feelings any if you rode
him outa town on a rail, but I&#8217;m not going to have you-all
mixed up in a lynching when there&#8217;s no need for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larson stole a look around the circle of faces. On the
whole he was glad Mrs. Gillespie had come. It took
only a few minutes to choke the life out of a man,
but there were many years left in which one might regret
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;O&#8217; course, if you say Miss Tolliver ain&#8217;t dangerous
sick, that makes a difference,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t see it,&#8221; Tom Reeves differed. &#8220;We know
what this fellow aimed to do, an&#8217; how he drove her to
the river to escape him. If you ask me, I&#8217;ll say&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But nobody&#8217;s askin&#8217; you, Tom,&#8221; Mollie cut into his
sentence sharply. &#8220;You&#8217;re just a fool boy chasin&#8217; cows&#8217;
tails for thirty dollars a month. I&#8217;m not going to have
any of this nonsense. Bear Cat&#8217;s a law-abidin&#8217; place.
We&#8217;re all proud of it. We don&#8217;t let bad-men strut
around an&#8217; shoot up our citizens, an&#8217; we don&#8217;t let half-grown
punchers go crazy an&#8217; start hangin&#8217; folks without
reason. Now do we?&#8221; A persuasive smile broke out on
the harsh face and transformed it. Every waif, every
under-dog, every sick woman and child within fifty
miles had met that smile and warmed to it.</p>
<p>Reeves gave up, grinning. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t such a kid either,
Mrs. Gillespie, but o&#8217; course you got to have yore way.
We all know that. What d&#8217; you want us to do with this
bird?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn him over to Simp an&#8217; let him put the fellow in
the jail. There&#8217;s just as good law right here as there is
anywhere. I&#8217;d hate to have it go out from here that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
Bear Cat can&#8217;t trust the officers it elects to see justice
done. Don&#8217;t you boys feel that way too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we even ride him outa town on a rail? You
done said we might.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gillespie hesitated. Why not? It was a crude
and primitive punishment, but it would take drastic
treatment to get under the hide of this sneering bully
who had come within an ace of ruining the life of June
Tolliver. The law could not touch him. He had not abducted
her. She had gone of her own volition. Unfulfilled
intentions are not criminal without an overt act.
Was he to escape scot free? She had scoffed at the idea
that June might die. But in her heart she was not so
sure. The fever was growing on her. It would be days
before the crisis was reached.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you promise, honest injun, not to kill or maim
him, not to do anything that will injure him permanent?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am. We&#8217;ll jes&#8217; jounce him up some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All agree to that?&#8221;</p>
<p>They did.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you go along with the boys, Jim?&#8221; She smiled.
&#8220;Just to see they&#8217;re not too&mdash;enthusiastic.&#8221;</p>
<p>The owner of the Wagon Rod said he would.</p>
<p>Mollie nodded. &#8220;All right, boys. The quicker the
sooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later Jake Houck went out of town
on a rail.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>A SCANDAL SCOTCHED</h3>
</div>

<p>Before the door of the room opened Tolliver heard
the high-pitched voice of his daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d only stood up to him, Bob&mdash;if you&#8217;d shot
him or fought him ... lemme go, Jake. You got no right
to take me with you. Tell you I&#8217;m married.... Yes,
sir, I&#8217;ll love, honor, an&#8217; obey. I sure will&mdash;in sickness
an&#8217; health&mdash;yes, sir, I do....&#8221;</p>
<p>The father&#8217;s heart sank. He knew nothing about illness.
A fear racked him that she might be dying. Piteously
he turned to the doctor, after one look at June&#8217;s
flushed face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she&mdash;is she&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of her head, Mr. Tolliver.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean&mdash;will she&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t promise you a thing yet. All we can do is look
after her and hope for the best. She&#8217;s young and strong.
It&#8217;s pretty hard to kill anybody born an&#8217; bred in these
hills. They&#8217;ve got tough constitutions. Better take a
chair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tolliver sat down on the edge of a chair, nursing his
hat. His leathery face worked. If he could only take
her place, go through this fight instead of her. It was
characteristic of his nature that he feared and expected
the worst. He was going to lose her. Of that he had no
doubt. It would be his fault. He was being punished
for the crimes of his youth and for the poltroonery that
had kept him from turning Jake out of the house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>June sat up excitedly in bed and pointed to a corner
of the room. &#8220;There he is, in the quaking asps, grinnin&#8217;
at me! Don&#8217;t you come nearer, Jake Houck! Don&#8217;t
you! If you do I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Tuckerman put his hand gently on her shoulder.
&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, June. Here&#8217;s your father. We won&#8217;t let
Houck near you. Better lie down now and rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why must I lie down?&#8221; she asked belligerently.
&#8220;Who are you anyhow, mister?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the doctor. You&#8217;re not quite well. We&#8217;re looking
after you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tolliver came forward timorously. &#8220;Tha&#8217;s right,
June. You do like the doctor says, honey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d just as lief, Dad,&#8221; she answered, and lay down
obediently.</p>
<p>When she was out of her head, at the height of the
fever, Mrs. Gillespie could always get her to take the
medicine and could soothe her fears and alarms. Mollie
was chief nurse. If she was not in the room, after
June had begun to mend, she was usually in the kitchen
cooking broths or custards for the sick girl.</p>
<p>June&#8217;s starved heart had gone out to her in passionate
loyalty and affection. No woman had ever been good
to her before, not since the death of her aunt, at least.
And Mollie&#8217;s goodness had the quality of sympathy. It
held no room for criticism or the sense of superiority.
She was a sinner herself, and it was in her to be tender
to others who had fallen from grace.</p>
<p>To Mollie this child&#8217;s innocent trust in her was exquisitely
touching. June was probably the only person
in the world except small children who believed in her in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
just this way. It was not possible that this faith could
continue after June became strong enough to move
around and talk with the women of Bear Cat. Though
she had outraged public opinion all her life, Mollie Gillespie
found herself tugged at by recurring impulses to
align herself as far as possible with respectability.</p>
<p>For a week she fought against the new point of view.
Grimly she scoffed at what she chose to consider a weakness.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a nice time o&#8217; day for you to try to turn
proper, Mollie Gillespie,&#8221; she told herself plainly. &#8220;Just
because a chit of a girl goes daffy over you, is that
any reason to change yore ways? You&#8217;d ought to have
a lick o&#8217; sense or two at yore age.&#8221;</p>
<p>But her derision was a fraud. She was tired of being
whispered about. The independent isolation of which
she had been proud had become of a sudden a thing
hateful to her.</p>
<p>She went to Larson as he was leaving the hotel dining-room
on his next visit to town.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to talk with you. Come outside a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>The owner of the Wagon Rod followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; she said, turning on him abruptly, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
always claimed you wanted to marry me.&#8221; Her blue
eyes searched deep into his. &#8220;Do you mean that? Or
is it just talk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I mean it, Mollie,&#8221; he answered quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m tired of being a scandal to Bear Cat. I&#8217;ve
always said I&#8217;d never get married again since my bad
luck with Hank Gillespie. But I don&#8217;t know. If you
really want to get married, Jim.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always thought it would be better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to quit runnin&#8217; this hotel, you understand.
You&#8217;re in town two-three days a week anyhow.
If you like you can build a house here an&#8217; we&#8217;ll move
into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get busy <i>pronto</i>. I expect you want a quiet wedding,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. We can go over to Blister&#8217;s office this afternoon.
You see him an&#8217; make arrangements. Tell him I
don&#8217;t want the boys to know anything about it till afterward.&#8221;</p>
<p>An hour later they stood before Justice Haines. Mollie
thought she detected a faint glimmer of mirth in his
eye after the ceremony. She quelled it promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you get gay with me, Blister&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The fat man&#8217;s impulse to smile fled. &#8220;Honest to goodness,
Mrs. Gillespie&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Larson,&#8221; she corrected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Larson,&#8221; he accepted. &#8220;I w-wish you m-many
happy returns.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him suspiciously and grunted &#8220;Hmp!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>BLISTER AS DEUS EX MACHINA</h3>
</div>

<p>Blister Haines found an old pair of chaps for Bob
Dillon and lent him a buckskin bronco. Also, he wrote a
note addressed to Harshaw, of the Slash Lazy D, and
gave it to the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll put you to ridin&#8217;, Ed will. The rest&#8217;s up to
you. D-don&#8217;t you forget you&#8217;re made in the l-likeness of
God. When you feel like crawlin&#8217; into a hole s-snap that
red haid up an&#8217; keep it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob grew very busy extricating a cockle burr from
the mane of the buckskin. &#8220;I&#8217;ll never forget what
you&#8217;ve done for me, Mr. Haines,&#8221; he murmured, beet
red.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! Nothin&#8217; a-tall. I&#8217;m always lookin&#8217; for to get a
chance to onload advice on some one. Prob&#8217;ly I was
meant to be a grandma an&#8217; got mixed in the shuffle.
Well, boy, don&#8217;t weaken. When in doubt, hop to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I&#8217;ll try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t w-worry about things beforehand. Nothin&#8217;s
ever as bad as you figure it&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be. A lickin&#8217;
don&#8217;t last but a few minutes, an&#8217; if you get b-busy
enough it&#8217;s the other fellow that&#8217;s liable to absorb it.
Watch that r-rampageous scalawag Dud Hollister an&#8217;
do like he does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; don&#8217;t forget that every m-mornin&#8217; begins a new
day. Tha&#8217;s all, son.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>Bob jogged down the road on this hazard of new fortune.</p>
<p>It chanced that Dud was still in town. Blister found
him and half a dozen other punchers in front of the
hotel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Betcha! Drinks for the crowd,&#8221; the justice heard
him say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go you,&#8221; Reeves answered, eyes dancing. &#8220;But no
monkey business. It&#8217;s to be a straight-away race from
the front of the hotel clear to the blacksmith shop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-day. Inside of ten minutes, you said,&#8221; Shorty
of the Keystone reminded Hollister. &#8220;An&#8217; this Sunday,
you recollect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dud&#8217;s gaze rested on a figure of a horseman moving
slowly up the road toward them. The approaching
rider was the Reverend Melanchthon T. Browning, late
of Providence, Rhode Island. He had come to the frontier
to teach it the error of its ways and bring a message
of sweetness and light to the unwashed barbarians of
the Rockies. He was not popular. This was due, perhaps,
to an unfortunate manner. The pompous little
man strutted and oozed condescension.</p>
<p>&#8220;W-what&#8217;s up?&#8221; asked Blister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dud&#8217;s bettin&#8217; he&#8217;ll get the sky pilot to race him
from here to Monty&#8217;s place,&#8221; explained Reeves. &#8220;Stick
around. He&#8217;ll want to borrow a coupla dollars from you
to buy the drinks.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Sunday afternoon. The missionary was returning
from South Park, where he had been conducting a
morning service. He was riding Tex Lindsay&#8217;s Blue
Streak, borrowed for the occasion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What deviltry you up to now, Dud?&#8221; Blister inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; The young puncher looked at him with a
bland face of innocence. &#8220;Why, Blister, you sure do me
wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dud sauntered to the hitching-rack, easy, careless,
graceful. He selected a horse and threw the rein over
its head. The preacher was just abreast of the hotel.</p>
<p>The puncher swung to the saddle and brought the
pony round. A wild whoop came from his throat. The
roan, touched by a spur, leaped to a canter. For an
instant it was side by side with Blue Streak. Then it
shot down the road.</p>
<p>Blue Streak was off in an eyeflash. It jumped to
a gallop and pounded after the roan. The Reverend
Melancthon T. Browning was no rider. His feet lost the
stirrups. A hymn-book went off at a wild tangent.
Coat-tails flew into the air. The exponent of sweetness
and light leaned forward and clung desperately to the
mane, crying, &#8220;Whoa! Stop! Desist!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Blue Streak had no intention of desisting as long
as the roan was in front. Tex Lindsay&#8217;s horse was a
racer. No other animal was going to pass it. The legs
of the dark horse stretched for the road. It flew past the
cowpony as though the latter had been trotting. The
Reverend Melancthon stuck to the saddle for dear life.</p>
<p>At the blacksmith shop Dud pulled up. He rode back
at a road gait to the hotel. His companions greeted him
with shouts of gayety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the parson?&#8221; some one asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Between here an&#8217; &#8217;Frisco somewheres. He was travelin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
like he was in a hurry when I saw him last. Who
pays for the drinks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, you darned ol&#8217; Piute,&#8221; shouted Reeves joyously.
&#8220;I never will forget how the sky pilot&#8217;s coat-tails
spread. You could &#8217;a&#8217; played checkers on &#8217;em. D&#8217;you
reckon we&#8217;d ought to send a wreckin&#8217; crew after Melancthon
T. Browning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no. The way he was clamped to that Blue
Streak&#8217;s back you couldn&#8217;t pry him loose with a crowbar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here he c-comes now,&#8221; Blister announced.</p>
<p>When the home missionary reached the hotel he
found a grave and decorous group of sympathizers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was surely right careless, sir, to start thataway so
onexpected,&#8221; Dud apologized. &#8220;I hope you didn&#8217;t get
jounced up much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one had ought to work you over for bein&#8217; so
plumb wooden-haided, Dud,&#8221; the puncher from the
Keystone reproved him. &#8220;Here was Mr. Browning
ridin&#8217; along quiet an&#8217; peaceable, figurin&#8217; out how he
could improve us Rio Blanco savages, an&#8217; you come
rip-rarin&#8217; along an&#8217; jar up all his geography by startin&#8217;
that fool horse of his&#8217;n.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dud hung his head. &#8220;Tha&#8217;s right. It was sure enough
thoughtless of me,&#8221; he murmured.</p>
<p>The preacher looked at the offender severely. He did
not yet feel quite equal to a fitting reprimand. &#8220;You
see the evil effects of letting that vile stuff pass your
lips. I hope this will be a lesson to you, young man. If
I had not kept my presence of mind I might have been
thrown and severely injured.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; agreed Dud in a small, contrite voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Makin&#8217; the preacher race on Sunday, too,&#8221; chided
Reeves. &#8220;Why, I shouldn&#8217;t wonder but what it might
get out an&#8217; spread scandalous. We&#8217;ll all have to tell
folks about it so&#8217;s they&#8217;ll get the right of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melancthon squirmed. He could guess how the story
would be told. &#8220;We&#8217;ll say no more about it, if you
please. The young man is sorry. I forgive him. His
offense was inadvertent even though vexatious. If he
will profit by this experience I will gladly suffer the
incommodious ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the missionary had gone and the bet been liquidated,
Blister drew Hollister to one side. &#8220;I&#8217;m guessin&#8217;
that when you get back to the ranch you&#8217;ll find a new
rider in the bunkhouse, Dud.&#8221;</p>
<p>The puncher waited. He knew this was preliminary
matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;That young fellow Bob Dillon,&#8221; explained the fat
man.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re expectin&#8217; me to throw up my hat an&#8217; shout,
Blister, I got to disappoint you,&#8221; Dud replied. &#8220;I like
&#8217;em man-size.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m p-puttin&#8217; him in yore charge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t either,&#8221; the range-rider repudiated indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;To m-make a man of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell&#8217;s bells! I&#8217;m no dry nurse to fellows shy of sand.
He can travel a lone trail for all of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep him kinda encouraged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why pick on me, Blister? I don&#8217;t want the job. He
ain&#8217;t there, I tell you. Any fellow that would let another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
guy take his wife away from him an&#8217; not hang his hide
up to dry&mdash;No, sir, I got no manner o&#8217; use for him.
You can&#8217;t onload him on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinkin&#8217; that when you are alone with him
some t-time you&#8217;d better devil him into a fight, then let
him whale the stuffin&#8217; outa you. That&#8217;ll do him a l-lot of
good&mdash;give him confidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hollister stared. His face broke slowly to a grin. &#8220;I
got to give it to you, Blister. I&#8217;ll bet there ain&#8217;t any
more like you at home. Let him lick me, eh? So&#8217;s to
give him confidence. Wallop me good an&#8217; plenty, you
said, didn&#8217;t you? By gum, you sure enough take the
cake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t hurt you any. You&#8217;ve give an&#8217; took plenty
of &#8217;em. Think of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of me, come to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;L-listen, Dud. That boy&#8217;s what they call c-c-constitutionally
timid. There&#8217;s folks that way, born so a
shadow scares &#8217;em. But he&#8217;s s-s-sensitive as a g-girl.
Don&#8217;t you make any mistake, son. He&#8217;s been eatin&#8217; his
h-heart out ever since he crawled before Houck. I like
that boy. There&#8217;s good s-stuff in him. At least I&#8217;m
makin&#8217; a bet there is. Question is, will it ever get a
chance to show? Inside of three months he&#8217;ll either win
out or he&#8217;ll be headed for hell, an&#8217; he won&#8217;t be travelin&#8217;
at no drift-herd gait neither.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every man&#8217;s got to stand on his own hind laigs,
ain&#8217;t he?&#8221; Hollister grunted. He was weakening, and
he knew it.</p>
<p>&#8220;He needs a friend, worst way,&#8221; Blister wheezed.
&#8220;&#8217;Course, if you&#8217;d rather not&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Doggone yore hide, you&#8217;re always stickin&#8217; me
somehow,&#8221; stormed the cowboy. &#8220;Trouble with me
is I&#8217;m so soft I&#8217;m always gettin&#8217; imposed on. I done
told you I didn&#8217;t like this guy a-tall. That don&#8217;t make
no more impression on you than a cold runnin&#8217;-iron
would on a cow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;M-much obliged, Dud. I knew you&#8217;d do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t said I&#8217;d do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;S-some of the boys are liable to get on the prod with
him. He&#8217;ll have to play his own hand. Tha&#8217;s reasonable.
But kinda back him up when you get a chance. That
notion of lettin&#8217; him lick you is a humdinger. Glad you
thought of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think of it, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t thinkin&#8217; of it now,&#8221;
Dud retorted. &#8220;You blamed old fat skeezicks, you lay
around figurin&#8217; out ways to make me trouble. You&#8217;re
worse than Mrs. Gillespie for gettin&#8217; yore own way.
Hmp! Devil him into a fight an&#8217; then let him hand me a
lacin&#8217;. I reckon not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll figure that since he can lick you, he can make
out to look after himself with the other boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t licked me yet, an&#8217; that&#8217;s only half of it. He
ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fuming at this outrageous proposition put up to him,
the puncher jingled away and left his triple-chinned
friend.</p>
<p>Blister grinned. The seed he had scattered might
have fallen among the rocks and the thorns, but he was
willing to make a small bet with himself that some of it
had lit on good ground and would bear fruit.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE BACK OF A BRONC</h3>
</div>

<p>The bunkhouse of the Slash Lazy D received Bob Dillon
gravely and with chill civility. He sat on his bunk
that first evening, close enough to touch a neighbor on
either hand, and was left as completely out of the conversation
as though he were a thousand miles away.
With each other the riders were jocular and familiar.
They &#8220;rode&#8221; one another with familiar jokes. The new
puncher they let alone.</p>
<p>Bob had brought some cigars with him. He offered
them eagerly to the chap-clad youth on his right. &#8220;Take
one, won&#8217;t you? An&#8217; pass the others round.&#8221;</p>
<p>The name of the cowboy was Hawks. He looked at
the cigars with disfavor. &#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll not be carin&#8217; for
a cigar to-night, thank you,&#8221; he said slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the others&mdash;if you&#8217;ll pass them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hawks handed the cigars to a brick-red Hercules
patching his overalls. From him they went to his neighbor.
Presently the cheroots came back to their owner.
They had been offered to every man in the room and
not one had been taken.</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s cheeks burned. Notice was being served on
him that the pleasant give-and-take of comradeship was
not for him. The lights went out early, but long into the
night the boy lay awake in torment. If he had been a
leper the line could scarcely have been drawn more
plainly. These men would eat with him because they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
must. They would sleep in the same room. They would
answer a question if he put it directly. But they would
neither give nor accept favors. He was not to be one of
them.</p>
<p>Many times in the months that were to follow he was
to know the sting of shame that burned him now at
memory of the scene between him and Jake Houck at
Bear Cat. He tossed on the bunk, burying his face in the
blankets in a vain effort to blot out the picture. Why
had he not shot the fellow? Why, at least, had he not
fought? If he had done anything, but what he did do?
If he had even stuck it out and endured the pain without
yielding.</p>
<p>In the darkness he lived over every little incident of
the evening. When Hawks had met him he had grinned
and hoped he would like the Slash Lazy D. There had
been friendliness in the crinkled, leathery face. But
when he passed Bob ten minutes later the blue eyes had
frozen. He had heard who the new rider was.</p>
<p>He would not stand it. He could not. In the morning
he would pack up his roll and ride back to Bear Cat. It
was all very well for Blister Haines to talk about standing
the gaff, but he did not have to put up with such
treatment.</p>
<p>But when morning came Bob set his teeth and resolved
to go through with it for a while anyhow. He
could quit at any time. He wanted to be able to tell the
justice that he had given his plan a fair trial.</p>
<p>In silence Bob ate his breakfast. This finished, the
riders moved across to the corral.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better rope and saddle you a mount,&#8221; Harshaw told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
his new man curtly. &#8220;Buck, you show him the ones he
can choose from.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hawks led the way to a smaller corral. &#8220;Any one o&#8217;
these except the roan with the white stockings an&#8217; the
pinto,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dillon walked through the gate of the enclosure and
closed it. He adjusted the rope, selected the bronco that
looked to him the meekest, and moved toward it. The
ponies began to circle close to the fence. The one he
wanted was racing behind the white-stockinged roan.
For a moment it appeared in front. The rope snaked out
and slid down its side. Bob gathered in the lariat, wound
it, waited for a chance, and tried again. The meek
bronco shook its head as the rope fell and caught on one
ear. A second time the loop went down into the dust.</p>
<p>Some one laughed, an unpleasant, sarcastic cackle.
Bob turned. Four or five of the punchers, mounted and
ready for the day&#8217;s work, were sitting at ease in their
saddles enjoying the performance.</p>
<p>Bob gave himself to the job in hand, though his ears
burned. As a youngster he had practiced roping. It was
a pastime of the boys among whom he grew up. But he
had never been an expert, and now such skill as he had
acquired deserted him. The loop sailed out half a dozen
times before it dropped over the head of the sorrel.</p>
<p>The new rider for the Slash Lazy D saddled and
cinched a bronco which no longer took an interest in the
proceedings. Out of the corner of his eye, without
once looking their way, Bob was aware of subdued hilarity
among the bronzed wearers of chaps. He attended
strictly to business.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>Just before he pulled himself to the saddle Bob felt a
momentary qualm at the solar plexus. He did not give
this time to let it deter him. His feet settled into the
stirrups. An instant violent earthquake disturbed his
equilibrium. A shock jarred him from the base of the
spine to the neck. Urgently he flew through space.</p>
<p>Details of the landscape gathered themselves together
again. From a corner of the corral Bob looked
out upon a world full of grinning faces. A sick dismay
rose in him and began to submerge his heart. They were
glad he had been thrown. The earth was inhabited by a
race of brutal and truculent savages. What was the use
of trying? He could never hold out against them.</p>
<p>Out of the mists of memory he heard a wheezy voice
issuing from a great bulk of a man&mdash;&#8220;... yore red
haid&#8217;s covered with glory. Snap it up!&#8221; The words
came so clear that for an instant he was startled. He
looked round half expecting to see Blister.</p>
<p>Stiffly he gathered himself out of the snow slush. A
pain jumped in the left shoulder. He limped to the rope
and coiled it. The first cast captured the sorrel.</p>
<p>His limbs were trembling when he dropped into the
saddle. With both hands he clung to the horn. Up went
the bronco on its hind legs. It pitched, bucked, sun-fished.
In sheer terror Bob clung like a leech. The
animal left the ground and jolted down stiff-legged on
all fours. The impact was terrific. He felt as though a
piledriver had fallen on his head and propelled his vital
organs together like a concertina. Before he could set
himself the sorrel went up again with a weaving, humpbacked
twist. The rider shot from the saddle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>When the scenery had steadied itself for Dillon he
noticed languidly a change in one aspect of it. The faces
turned toward him were no longer grinning. They were
watching him expectantly. What would he do now?</p>
<p>They need not look at him like that. He was through.
If he got on the back of that brute again it would kill
him. Already he was bleeding at the nose and ears.
Sometimes men died just from the shock of being tossed
about so furiously.</p>
<p>The sorrel was standing by itself at the other end of
the corral. Its head was drooping languidly. The bronco
was a picture of injured innocence.</p>
<p>Bob discovered that he hated it with an impotent lust
to destroy. If he had a gun with him&mdash;Out of the air
a squeaky voice came to him: &#8220;C-clamp yore jaw, you
worm! You been given dominion.&#8221; And after that, a
moment later, &#8220;... made in the image of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unsteadily he rose. The eyes of the Slash Lazy D
riders watched him relentlessly and yet curiously.
Would he quit? Or would he go through?</p>
<p>He had an odd feeling that his body was a thing detached
from himself. It was full of aches and pains. Its
legs wobbled as he moved. Its head seemed swollen to
twice the normal size. He had strangely small control
over it. When he walked, it was jerkily, as a drunk man
sometimes does. His hand caught at the fence to steady
himself. He swayed dizzily. A surge of sickness swept
through his organs. After this he felt better. He had not
consciously made up his mind to try again, but he found
himself moving toward the sorrel. This time he could
hardly drag his weight into the saddle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>The mind of a bronco is unfathomable. This one now
pitched weakly once or twice, then gave up in unconditional
surrender. Bob&#8217;s surprise was complete. He had
expected, after being shaken violently, to be flung into
the mire again. The reaction was instantaneous and exhilarating.
He forgot that he was covered with mud and
bruises, that every inch of him cried aloud with aches.
He had won, had mastered a wild outlaw horse as he had
seen busters do. For the moment he saw the world at
his feet. A little lower than the angels, he had been
given dominion.</p>
<p>He rode to the gate and opened it. Hawks was looking
at him, a puzzled look in his eyes. He had evidently
seen something he had not expected to see.</p>
<p>Harshaw had ridden up during the bronco-busting.
He spoke now to Bob. &#8220;You&#8217;ll cover Beaver Creek to-day&mdash;you
and Buck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something in the cattleman&#8217;s eye, in the curtness of
his speech, brought Dillon back to earth. He had divined
that his boss did not like him, had employed him
only because Blister Haines had made a personal point
of it. Harshaw was a big weather-beaten man of forty,
hard, keen-eyed, square as a die. Game himself, he had
little patience with those who did not stand the acid test.</p>
<p>Bob felt himself shrinking up. He had not done anything
after all, nothing that any one of these men could
not do without half trying. There was no way to wipe
out his failure when a real ordeal had confronted him.
What was written in the book of life was written.</p>
<p>He turned his pony and followed Hawks across the
mesa.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE FIRST DAY</h3>
</div>

<p>In the wake of Hawks Bob rode through the buckbrush.
There was small chance for conversation, and in any
case neither of them was in the mood for talk. Bob&#8217;s
sensitive soul did not want to risk the likelihood of a rebuff.
He was susceptible to atmospheres, and he knew
that Buck was sulky at being saddled with him.</p>
<p>He was right. Buck did not see why Harshaw had put
this outcast tenderfoot on him. He did not see why he
had hired him at all. One thing was sure. He was not
going to let the fellow get round him. No, sir. Not on
his tintype he wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Since it was the only practical way at present to show
his disgust and make the new puncher feel like a fool,
Hawks led him through the roughest country he could
find at the fastest feasible gait. Buck was a notably
wild rider in a country of reckless horsemen. Like all
punchers, he had been hurt time and again. He had
taken dozens of falls. Two broncos had gone down
under him with broken necks. A third had twisted its
leg in a beaver burrow and later had to be shot. This
day he outdid himself.</p>
<p>As young Dillon raced behind him along side hills
after dogies fleet as blacktails, the heart fluttered in his
bosom like a frightened bird in a cage. He did not pretend
to keep up with Hawks. The best he could do was
to come loping up after the excitement was over. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
range-rider made no spoken comment whatever, but
his scornful blue eyes said all that was necessary.</p>
<p>The day&#8217;s work did not differ except in details from
that of yesterday and to-morrow. They headed back
two three-year-olds drifting too far north. They came
on a Slash Lazy D cow with a young calf and moved it
slowly down to better feed near the creek. In the afternoon
they found a yearling sunk in a bog. After trying
to pull it out by the ears, they roped its body and tugged
together. Their efforts did not budge the animal.
Hawks tied one end of the rope to the saddle-horn,
swung up, and put the pony to the pull. The muscles of
the bronco&#8217;s legs stood out as it leaned forward and
scratched for a foothold. The calf blatted with pain, but
presently it was snaked out from the quagmire to the
firm earth.</p>
<p>They crossed the creek and returned on the other side.
Late in the afternoon they met half a dozen Utes riding
their inferior ponies. They had evidently been hunting,
for most of them carried deer. Old Colorow was at their
head.</p>
<p>He grunted &#8220;How!&#8221; sulkily. The other braves
passed without speaking. Something in their manner
sent a shiver up Dillon&#8217;s spine. He and Hawks were
armed only with revolvers. It would be the easiest thing
in the world for the Indians to kill them if they wished.</p>
<p>Hawks called a cheerful greeting. It suggested the
friendliest of feeling. The instructions given to the
punchers were to do nothing to irritate the Utes just
now.</p>
<p>The mental attitude of the Indians toward the cattlemen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
and cowboys was a curious one. They were suspicious
of them. They resented their presence in the country.
But they felt a very wholesome respect for them.
These leather-chapped youths could outride and outshoot
them. With or without reason, the Utes felt only
contempt for soldiers. They were so easily led into
traps. They bunched together when under fire instead
of scattering for cover. They did not know how to read
sign on the warmest trail. These range-riders were different.
If they were not as wary as the Utes, they made
up for it by the dash and aplomb with which they broke
through difficulties.</p>
<p>In Bear Cat the day before Bob had heard settlers discuss
the unrest of the Indians. The rumor was that soon
they meant to go on the warpath again. Colorow himself,
with a specious air of good will, had warned a cattleman
to leave the country while there was time.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mebbe go&mdash;mebbe not come back,&#8221; he had
suggested meaningly. &#8220;Mebbe better so. Colorow
friend. He speak wise words.&#8221;</p>
<p>Until the Utes were out of gunshot Bob felt very uneasy.
It was not many years since the Meeker massacre
and the ambushing of Major Thornburg&#8217;s troops on
Milk Creek.</p>
<p>Reeves and Hollister were in the bunkhouse when
Bob entered it just before supper. He heard Dud&#8217;s
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;... don&#8217;t like a hair of his red haid, but that&#8217;s how
it&#8217;ll be far as I&#8217;m concerned.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a moment&#8217;s awkward silence. Dillon knew
they had been talking about him. Beneath the deep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
gold of his blond skin Hollister flushed. Boy though he
was, Dud usually had the self-possession of the Sphinx.
But momentarily he was embarrassed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, fellow!&#8221; he shouted across the room.
&#8220;How&#8217;d she go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I reckon,&#8221; Bob answered. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t
much use.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wanted to ask Dud a question, but he dared not
ask it before anybody else. It hung in his mind all
through supper. Afterward he found his chance. He
did not look at Hollister while he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did&mdash;did you hear how&mdash;Miss Tolliver is?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doc says he can&#8217;t tell a thing yet. She&#8217;s still mighty
sick. But Blister he sent word to you that he&#8217;d let you
know soon as there is a change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much obliged.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob moved away. He did not want to annoy anybody
by pressing his undesirable society upon him.</p>
<p>That night he slept like a hibernating bear. The
dread of the morrow was no longer so heavy upon him.
Drowsily, while his eyes were closing, he recalled the
prediction of the fat justice that no experience is as bad
as one&#8217;s fears imagine it will be. That had been true to-day
at least. Even his fight with the sorrel, the name of
which he had later discovered to be Powder River, was
now only a memory which warmed and cheered.</p>
<p>Cowpunchers usually rode in couples. Bob learned
next morning that he was paired with Dud. They were
to comb the Crooked Wash country.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>DUD QUALIFIES AS COURT JESTER</h3>
</div>

<p>It was still dark when Dud Hollister and Bob Dillon
waded through the snow to the corral and saddled their
horses.</p>
<p>They jogged across the mesa through the white
drifts.</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s pony stumbled into a burrow, but pulled out
again without damage.</p>
<p>In the years when cattle first came to the Rio Blanco
the danger from falls was greater than it is now, even if
the riding had not been harder. A long thick grass often
covered the badger holes.</p>
<p>&#8220;How does a fellow look out for badger and prairie-dog
holes?&#8221; Bob asked his companion as they jogged
along at a road gait. &#8220;I mean when he&#8217;s chasin&#8217; dogies
across a hill on the jump.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He don&#8217;t,&#8221; Dud answered ungrammatically but
promptly. &#8220;His bronc &#8217;tends to that. If you try to
guide you&#8217;re sure enough liable to take a fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But when the hole&#8217;s covered with grass?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You gotta take a chance,&#8221; Dud said. &#8220;They&#8217;re
sure-footed, these cowponies are. A fellow gets to
thinkin&#8217; they can&#8217;t fall. Then down he goes. He jumps
clear if he can an&#8217; lights loose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if he can&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s liable to get stove up. I seen five waddies
yesterday in Bear Cat with busted legs or arms. Doc&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
fixin&#8217; &#8217;em up good as new. In a week or two they&#8217;ll be
ridin&#8217; again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob had seen those same crippled cowboys and he
could not quite get them out of his mind. He knew of
two punchers killed within the year from falls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ridin&#8217; for a dogie outfit ain&#8217;t no sin-cure, as Blister
told you while he was splicin&#8217; you &#8217;n&#8217; Miss Tolliver,&#8221;
Dud went on. &#8220;It&#8217;s a man-size job. There&#8217;s ol&#8217; Charley
Mason now. He&#8217;s had his ribs stove in, busted an
arm, shot hisself by accident, got rheumatism, had his
nose bit off by a railroad guy while he was b&#8217;iled, an&#8217;
finally married a female battle-axe, all inside o&#8217; two
years. He&#8217;s the hard luck champeen, though, Charley
is.&#8221;</p>
<p>It had snowed heavily during the night. The day was
&#8220;soft,&#8221; in the phrase of the pioneer. In places the
ground was almost clear. In others the drifts were deep.
From a hillside they looked down into a grove of cottonwoods
that filled a small draw. Here the snow had
blown in and was heavy. Three elk were floundering in
the white banks.</p>
<p>Dud waded in and shot two with his revolver. The
third was a doe. The cowponies snaked them out to the
open.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take &#8217;em with us to &#8217;Leven Mile camp,&#8221; Dud
said. &#8220;Then we&#8217;ll carry &#8217;em back to the ranch to-morrow.
The Slash Lazy D is needin&#8217; meat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harshaw had given orders that they were to spend the
night at Eleven Mile camp. The place was a deserted
log cabin built by a trapper. Supplies were kept there
for the use of Slash Lazy D riders. Usually some of them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
were there at least two or three nights a week. Often
punchers from other outfits put up at the shack. Range
favors of this sort were taken as a matter of course. If
the cabin was empty the visiting cowboy helped himself
to food, fire, and shelter. It was expected of him
that he would cut a fresh supply of fuel to take the
place of that he had used.</p>
<p>It was getting on toward dusk when they reached
Eleven Mile. Bob made a fire in the tin stove while Dud
took care of the horses. He found flour and lard<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> hanging
in pails from the rafters. Coffee was in a tin under
the bunk.</p>
<p>Soon Dud joined him. They made their supper of
venison, biscuits, and coffee. Hollister had just lit a
pipe and stretched himself on the bed when the door
opened and sixteen Ute bucks filed gravely in.</p>
<p>Colorow was the spokesman. &#8220;Hungry! Heap hungry!&#8221;
he announced.</p>
<p>Hollister rolled out of the bunk promptly. &#8220;Here&#8217;s
where we go into the barbecue business an&#8217; the Slash
ranch loses them elk,&#8221; he told Bob under cover of replenishing
the fire in the stove. &#8220;An&#8217; I can name two
lads who&#8217;ll be lucky if they don&#8217;t lose their scalps.
These birds have been drinkin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>It took no wiseacre to divine the condition of the Indians.
Their whiskey breaths polluted the air of the
cabin. Some of them swayed as they stood or clutched
at one another for support. Fortunately they were for
the moment in a cheerful rather than a murderous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
frame of mind. They chanted what was gibberish to
the two whites while the latter made their preparations
swiftly. Dud took charge of affairs. He noticed that
his companion was white to the lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll knock together a batch of biscuits while you fry
the steaks. Brace up, kid. Throw out yore chest. We
better play we&#8217;re drunk too,&#8221; he said in a murmur that
reached only Bob.</p>
<p>While Bob sliced the steaks from the elk hanging from
pegs fastened in the mud mortar between the logs of the
wall, Dud was busy whipping up a batch of biscuits.
The Indians, packed tight as sardines in the room,
crowded close to see how it was done. Hollister had two
big frying-pans on the stove with lard heating in them.
He slapped the dough in, spattering boiling grease right
and left. One pockmarked brave gave an anguished
howl of pain. A stream of sizzling lard had spurted into
his face.</p>
<p>The other Utes roared with glee. The aboriginal
sense of humor may not be highly developed, but it is
easily aroused. The friends of the outraged brave
stamped up and down the dirt floor in spasms of mirth.
They clapped him on the back and jabbered ironic inquiries
as to his well-being. For the moment, at least,
Dud was as popular as a funny clown in a sawdust ring.</p>
<p>Colorow and his companions were fed. The stove
roared. The frying-pans were kept full of meat and biscuits.
The two white men discarded coats, vests, and
almost their shirts. Sweat poured down their faces.
They stood over the red-hot cook stove, hour after hour,
while the Utes gorged. The steaks of the elk, the hind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
quarters, the fore quarters, all vanished into the sixteen
distended stomachs. Still the Indians ate, voraciously,
wolfishly, as though they could never get enough. It
was not a meal but an endurance contest.</p>
<p>Occasionally some wag would push forward the pockmarked
brave and demand of Dud that he baptize him
again, and always the puncher made motions of going
through the performance a second time. The joke never
staled. It always got a hand, no matter how often it was
repeated. At each encore the Utes stamped their flatfooted
way round the room in a kind of impromptu and
mirthful dance. The baptismal jest never ceased to be a
scream.</p>
<p>Dud grinned at Dillon. &#8220;These wooden heads are so
fond of chestnuts I&#8217;m figurin&#8217; on springin&#8217; on them the
old one about why a hen crosses the road. Bet it would
go big. If they got the point. But I don&#8217;t reckon they
would unless I had a hen here to show &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>The feast ended only when the supplies gave out.
Two and a half sacks of flour disappeared. About fifteen
pounds of potatoes went into the pot and from it into
the openings of copper-colored faces. Nothing was left
of the elk but the bones.</p>
<p>&#8220;The party&#8217;s mighty nigh over,&#8221; Dud murmured.
&#8220;Wonder what our guests aim to do now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we feed &#8217;em anything more?&#8221; asked Bob
anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless we finish cookin&#8217; the pockmarked gent
for &#8217;em. I&#8217;m kinda hopin&#8217; old Colorow will have sabe
enough not to wear his welcome out. It&#8217;d make a ten-strike
with me if he&#8217;d say &#8216;Much obliged&#8217; an&#8217; hit the
trail.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>Bob had not the heart to jest about the subject, and
his attempt to back up his companion&#8217;s drunken playacting
was a sad travesty. He did not know much about
Indians anyhow, and he was sick through and through
with apprehension. Would they finish by scalping their
hosts, as Dud had suggested early in the evening?</p>
<p>It was close to midnight when the clown of Colorow&#8217;s
party invented a new and rib-tickling joke. Bob was
stooping over the stove dishing up the last remnants of
the potatoes when this buck slipped up behind with the
carving-knife and gathered into his fist the boy&#8217;s flaming
topknot. He let out a horrifying yell and brandished
the knife.</p>
<p>In a panic of terror Bob collapsed to the floor. There
was a moment when the slapstick comedy grazed red
tragedy. The pitiable condition of the boy startled the
Ute, who still clutched his hair. An embryonic idea was
finding birth in the drunken brain. In another moment
it would have developed into a well-defined lust to kill.</p>
<p>With one sweeping gesture Dud lifted a frying-pan
from the red-hot stove and clapped it against the rump
of the jester. The redskin&#8217;s head hit the roof. His shriek
of agony could have been heard half a mile. He clapped
hands to the afflicted part and did a humped-up dance
of woe. The carving-knife lay forgotten on the floor. It
was quite certain that he would take no pleasure in sitting
down for some few days.</p>
<p>Again a series of spasms of turbulent mirth seized
upon his friends. They doubled up with glee. They
wept tears of joy. They howled down his anguish with
approving acclaim while they did a double hop around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
him as a vent to their enthusiasm. The biter had been
bit. The joke had been turned against the joker, and in
the most primitive and direct way. This was the most
humorous event in the history of the Rio Blanco Utes.
It was destined to become the stock tribal joke.</p>
<p>Dud, now tremendously popular, joined in the dance.
As he shuffled past Bob he growled an order at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up on yore hind laigs an&#8217; dance. I got these
guys going my way. Hop to it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob danced, at first feebly and with a heart of water.
He need not have worried. If Dud had asked to be made
a blood member of the tribe he would have been elected
by fourteen out of the sixteen votes present.</p>
<p>The first faint streaks of day were in the sky when the
Utes mounted their ponies and vanished over the hill.
From the door Dud watched them go. It had been a
strenuous night, and he was glad it was over. But he
wouldn&#8217;t have missed it for a thousand dollars. He
would not have admitted it. Nevertheless he was immensely
proud of himself in the rôle of court jester.</p>
<p>Bob sat down on the bunk. He was a limp rag of
humanity. In the reaction from fear he was inclined to
be hysterical.</p>
<p>&#8220;You saved my life&mdash;when&mdash;when that fellow&mdash;&#8221;
He stopped, gulping down a lump in the throat.</p>
<p>The man leaning against the door-jamb stretched his
arms and his mouth in a relaxing yawn. &#8220;Say, fellow,
I wasn&#8217;t worryin&#8217; none about yore life. I was plumb
anxious for a moment about Dud Hollister&#8217;s. If old
Colorow&#8217;s gang had begun on you they certainly
wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; quit without takin&#8217; my topknot for a souvenir
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
of an evenin&#8217; when a pleasant time was had by
all.&#8221; He yawned a second time. &#8220;What say? Let&#8217;s hit
the hay. I don&#8217;t aim for to do no ridin&#8217; this mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>A faint sniffling sound came from the bunk.</p>
<p>Dud turned. &#8220;What&#8217;s ailin&#8217; you now?&#8221; he wanted to
know.</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s face was buried in his hands. The slender body
of the boy was shaken with sobs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut out the weeps, Miss Roberta,&#8221; snapped Hollister.
&#8220;What in Mexico &#8217;s eatin&#8217; you anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;ve had a horrible night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I know it? Do you reckon it was a picnic for
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;laughed an&#8217; cut up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one had to throw a bluff. If they&#8217;d guessed we
were scared stiff them b&#8217;iled Utes sure enough would
have massacreed us. You got to learn to keep yore grin
workin&#8217;, fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, but&mdash;&#8221; Bob stopped. Dry sobs were still
shaking him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quit that,&#8221; Dud commanded. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be darned if
I&#8217;ll stand for it. You shut off the waterworks or I&#8217;ll
whale you proper.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked out to look at the horses. It had suddenly
occurred to him that perhaps their guests might have
found and taken them. The broncos were still grazing
in the draw where he had left them the previous night.</p>
<p>When Dud returned to the cabin young Dillon had
recovered his composure. He lay on the bunk, face to
the wall, and pretended to be asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>&#8220;THE BIGGER THE HAT THE SMALLER THE HERD&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Combing Crooked Wash that afternoon Bob rode with a
heavy and despondent heart. It was with him while he
and Dud jogged back to the ranch in the darkness. He
had failed again. Another man had trodden down the
fears to which he had afterward lightly confessed and
had carried off the situation with a high hand. His admiration
put Hollister on a pedestal. How had the
blond puncher contrived to summon that reserve of
audacity which had so captivated the Utes? Why was
it that of two men one had stamina to go through regardless
of the strain while another went to pieces and
made a spectacle of himself?</p>
<p>Bob noticed that both in his report to Harshaw and
later in the story he told at the Slash Lazy D bunkhouse,
Dud shielded him completely. He gave not even a hint
that Dillon had weakened under pressure. The boy was
grateful beyond words, even while he was ashamed that
he needed protection.</p>
<p>At the bunkhouse Dud&#8217;s story was a great success.
He had a knack of drawling out his climaxes with humorous
effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; when I laid that red-hot skillet on the nearest
area of Rumpty-Tumpty&#8217;s geography he ce&#8217;tainly went
up into the roof like he&#8217;d been fired out of a rocket.
When he lit&mdash;gentlemen, when he lit he was the most

restless Ute in western Colorado. He milled around the
corral considerable. I got a kinda notion he&#8217;d sorta
soured on the funny-boy business. Anyhow, he didn&#8217;t
cotton to my style o&#8217; humor. Different with old Colorow
an&#8217; the others. They liked to &#8217;a&#8217; hollered their fool haids
off at the gent I&#8217;d put the new Slash Lazy D brand on.
Then they did one o&#8217; them &#8216;Wow-wow-wow&#8217; dances
round Rumpty-Tumpty, who was still smokin&#8217; like he&#8217;d
set fire to the cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cowpunchers are a paradox. They have the wisdom
of the ages, yet they are only grown-up children. Now
they filled the night with mirth. Hawks lay down on his
bunk and kicked his feet into the air joyfully. Reeves
fell upon Dud and beat him with profane gayety. Big
Bill waltzed him over the floor, regardless of his good-humored
protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us some more, Dud,&#8221; demanded the cook.
&#8220;Did yore friend Rumpty put hisse&#8217;f out by sittin&#8217; in a
snowbank?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t rightly recollect. Me &#8217;n&#8217; Bob here was
elected to lead the grand march an&#8217; we had to leave
Rumpty-Tumpty be his own fire department. But I
did notice how tender he lowered himself to the back of
his hawse when they lit out in the mawnin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob saw that Hollister made the whole affair one huge
joke. He did not mention that there had been any
chance of a tragic termination to the adventure. Nor
did the other punchers refer to that, though they knew
the strained relations between the whites and the Utes.
Riding for a dogie outfit was a hard life, but one could
always get a laugh out of it somehow. The philosophy
of the range is to grin and bear it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>A few days later Bob rode into town with a pack-horse
at heel. He was to bring back some supplies for
the ranch. Harshaw had chosen him to go because he
wanted to buy some things for himself. These would be
charged against the Slash Lazy D account at Platt &amp;
Fortner&#8217;s store. Bob would settle for them with the
boss when his pay-check came due.</p>
<p>It was a warm sunny day with a touch of summer
still in the air. The blue stem and the bunch grass were
dry. Sage and greasewood had taken on the bare look of
winter. But the pines were still green and the birds
singing.</p>
<p>It was an ordeal for Bob to face Bear Cat. June was
better, he had heard. But it was not his fault she had
not died of the experience endured. He could expect no
friendliness in the town. The best he could hope for was
that it would let him alone.</p>
<p>He went straight to the office of Blister Haines. The
justice took his fat legs down from the desk and waved
him to a chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;re cases?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Bob told his story without sparing himself.</p>
<p>Blister listened and made no comment to the end.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re takin&#8217; that Ute business too s-serious,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Gettin&#8217; s-scalped &#8217;s no picnic. You&#8217;re entitled to
feel some weak at the knees. I&#8217;ve heard from Dud. He
says you stood up fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He told you&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N-no particulars. T-trouble with you is you&#8217;ve got
too much imagination. From yore story I judge you
weakened when the danger was over. You gotta learn to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
keep up that red haid like I said. When you&#8217;re scared or
all in, stretch yore grin another inch. You don&#8217;t need to
w-worry. You&#8217;re doin&#8217; all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob shook his head. Blister&#8217;s view encouraged him,
though he could not agree with it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep yore eye on that Dud Hollister hombre,&#8221; the
justice went on. &#8220;He&#8217;s one sure enough go-getter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Bob. &#8220;He&#8217;s there every jump of the
road. An&#8217; he didn&#8217;t tell on me either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can tie to Dud,&#8221; agreed Blister. &#8220;Here&#8217;s the
point, son. When you g-get that sinkin&#8217; feelin&#8217; in yore
tummy it&#8217;s notice for you to get up on yore hind laigs
an&#8217; howl. Be a wolf for a change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t. I seem to&mdash;to wilt all up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Son, you know the answer already. T-throw back
yore haid an&#8217; remember you got dominion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dillon shifted the conversation, embarrassed eyes on
the floor. &#8220;How&#8217;s&mdash;Miss Tolliver?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;G-gettin&#8217; well fast. On the porch yesterday. Everybody
in town stopped to say how g-glad they was to see
her out. Been havin&#8217; the time of her life, June has.
Mollie&#8217;s always right good to sick folks, but she c-ce&#8217;tainly
makes a pet of June.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad. She&#8217;s through with me, o&#8217; course, but I
hope her friends look out for that Jake Houck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to worry about him. He&#8217;s learnt to
keep hands off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob was not quite satisfied to let the matter rest
there. In spite of the fact that he had made an outcast
of himself he wanted to reinstate himself with June.</p>
<p>Hesitantly Bob approached the subject. &#8220;Maybe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
I&#8217;d better send her word I&#8217;m glad she come through all
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blister&#8217;s eyes were stony. &#8220;Maybe you&#8217;d better not.
What claim you got to be remembered by that li&#8217;l&#8217; girl?
You&#8217;re outa her life, boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob winced. The harsh truth wounded his sensitive
nature. She had been his friend once. It hurt him to
lose her wholly and completely.</p>
<p>He rose. &#8220;Well, I gotta go an&#8217; get some goods for the
ranch, Mr. Haines,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;d like to s-slide back easy an&#8217; have
folks forget,&#8221; Blister said. &#8220;Natural enough. But it
won&#8217;t be thataway. You&#8217;ll have to f-fight like a bulldog
to travel back along that trail to a good name. You
ain&#8217;t really begun yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See you again next time I get to town,&#8221; Bob said.</p>
<p>He was sorry he had raised the point with Haines of a
message to June. That the justice should reject the idea
so promptly and vigorously hurt his pride and self-esteem.</p>
<p>At Platt &amp; Fortner&#8217;s he invested in a pair of spurs, a
cheap saddle, and a bridle. The cowboy is vain of his
equipment. He would spend in those days forty dollars
for a saddle, ten for boots, twenty-five for a bridle and
silver plated bit, fifteen for spurs, and ten or twelve for a
hat. He owned his own horse and blankets, sometimes
also a pack-animal. These were used to carry him from
one job to another. He usually rode the ranch broncos
on the range.</p>
<p>But even if he had been able to afford it Bob would
not have bought expensive articles. He did not make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
any claim about his ability to punch cattle, and he knew
instinctively that real riders would resent any attempt
on his part to swagger as they did. A remark dropped
by Blister came to mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;The b-bigger the hat the smaller the herd, son. Do
all yore b-braggin&#8217; with yore actions.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is often a characteristic of weakness that it clings to
strength. Bob would have given much for the respect
and friendship of these clear-eyed, weather-beaten men.
To know that he had forfeited these cut deep into his
soul. The clerk that waited on him at the store joked
gayly with two cowboys lounging on the counter, but he
was very distantly polite to Dillon. The citizens he met
on the street looked at him with chill eyes. A group of
schoolboys whispered and pointed toward him.</p>
<p>Bob had walked out from Haines&#8217;s office in a huff, but
as he rode back to the ranch he recognized the justice of
his fat friend&#8217;s decision. He had forfeited the right to
take any interest in June Tolliver. His nature was to
look always for the easiest way. He never wanted trouble
with anybody. Essentially he was peace-loving even
to the point of being spiritless. To try to slip back into
people&#8217;s good will by means of the less robust virtues
would be just like him.</p>
<p>Probably Blister was right when he had told him to be a
wolf. For him, anything was better than to be a sheep.</p>
<p>He clamped his teeth. He would show the Rio
Blanco country whether he had a chicken heart. He
would beat back somehow so that they would have to
respect him whether they wanted to or not. If he made
up his mind to it he could be just as game as Dud Hollister.</p>
<p>He would go through or he would die trying.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>JUNE DISCOVERS A NEW WORLD</h3>
</div>

<p>Blister had not overstated the case to Bob when he
told him that June had been having the time of her life
getting well. She had been a lonely little thing, of small
importance in a country very busy on its own affairs.
The sense of inferiority had oppressed her, due both to
the secret of her father&#8217;s past and the isolation in which
she dwelt. This had stimulated a sullen resentment and
a shy pride which held even friendly souls at arm&#8217;s
length.</p>
<p>Now she was being petted by everybody with whom
she came into contact. She was pathetically grateful,
and the big-hearted men and women of the frontier
were worthy of the feeling. They gave her eager good
will and generous sympathy. Into her room came soups
and custards made by the best cooks on the river. When
she was well enough to see visitors the mothers of Bear
Cat came in person.</p>
<p>Through Melancthon Browning the landlady of the
hotel shrewdly enlisted the aid of the most influential
women in the community. June needed clothes. She
had not a garment that was not worn out and ragged.
But Mollie recognized the fact that more than these she
was in need of the moral support of the settlers&#8217; wives.
Mrs. Larson could give her work and a home, but she
could not give her that bulwark of her sex, respectability.
Mollie was an exception to an established rule. She was
liked and respected by other women in spite of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
peculiarities. But this would not be true of her protégée
unless the girl was above criticism. June must never
step inside the bar or the gambling-room. She must find
friends among the other girls of the town and take part
in their social activities.</p>
<p>Wherefore Mollie, by timely suggestion, put it into
the mind of the preacher to propose a sewing-bee to his
congregation. Tolliver, under supervision, bought the
goods and the women sewed. They made underclothes,
petticoats, nightgowns, and dresses. They selected
from the stock of Platt &amp; Fortner shoes, stockings, and
a hat, charging them to the account of Pete.</p>
<p>It was on her sixteenth birthday that June was taken
into an adjoining room and saw all these treasures laid
upon the bed. She did not at first understand that the
two pretty dresses and all the comfortable, well-made
clothes were for her. When this was made clear to her
the tears brimmed to the long-lashed eyes. The starved
little Cinderella was greatly touched. She turned to
Mollie and buried her twitching face in a friendly bosom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now&mdash;now&mdash;now,&#8221; Mollie reproved gently, stroking
the dark crisp hair. &#8220;This is no way to act, dearie,
an&#8217; all the ladies so kind to you. You want to thank
&#8217;em, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but&mdash;but&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The smothered voice was tearful.</p>
<p>Mollie smiled at the committee. &#8220;I reckon she wants
me to tell you for her that she&#8217;s plumb outa words to
let you know how good she thinks you-all are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The black head nodded vigorously. &#8220;You&#8217;re the <i>best</i>
folks&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Platt, a large and comfortable mother of seven,
answered placidly. &#8220;I expect you&#8217;ll find, dearie, that
most folks are good when you get on the right side of
them. Now you try on them clothes an&#8217; see if they fit.
We tried &#8217;em on my Mary. She&#8217;s about your size.
You&#8217;re comin&#8217; down to our house to supper to-night. I
want you should get acquainted with the girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>June looked at Mollie, who nodded smilingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be terrible glad to come, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; June said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then that&#8217;s settled. They&#8217;re nice girls, if I do say it
myself that am their mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>So June took her first timid steps into the social life of
the frontier town. Shyly she made friends, and with
them went to church, to Sunday School, and to picnics.</p>
<p>It had been definitely decided that she was to wait on
table at the hotel restaurant and not return with her
father to Piceance Creek. The plan had originated with
Mollie, but Tolliver had acquiesced in it eagerly. If
June went home with him Houck might reappear on the
horizon, but if she stayed at Bear Cat, buttressed by the
support of the town, the man from Brown&#8217;s Park would
not dare to urge his claim again.</p>
<p>June waited on table at the hotel, but this did not
keep her from the dances that were held in the old army
hospital building. There were no class distinctions in
Bear Cat then. There are not many now. No paupers
lived in the county. This still holds good. Except the
owners of the big cattle companies there were no men of
wealth. A man was not judged by what he had or by the
kind of work he was doing. His neighbors looked through
externals to see what he was, stripped of all adventitious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
circumstance. On that basis solely he was taken
into fellowship or cast out from it.</p>
<p>The girl from Piceance Creek worked hard and was
content, even if not quite happy. If she ever thought
of the boy she had married, no reference to him ever
crossed her lips. She was known simply as June by
the town. Strangers called her Miss Tolliver.</p>
<p>There was about her a quiet self-possession that discouraged
familiarity on the part of ambitious and amorous
cowboys. Her history, with its thread of tragedy
running through the warp and woof of it, set her apart
from other girls of her age. Still almost a child in years,
she had been caught in the cross-currents of life and
beaten by its cold waves. Part of the heritage of youth&mdash;its
gay and adventurous longing for experience&mdash;had
been filched from her before she was old enough to
know its value. In time she would perhaps recover her
self-esteem, but she would never know in its fullness
that divine right of American maidenhood to rule its
environment and make demands of it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>AN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSED AND DECLINED</h3>
</div>

<p>The prediction made by Blister Haines that some overbearing
puncher would bully Bob because of his reputation
as safe game did not long wait fulfillment. A new
rider joined the Slash Lazy D outfit. He had been working
for the K Bar T for a couple of months. Prior to that
time he had not been seen on the river. The rumor was
that he hailed from Wyoming. To ask for more specific
information would not have been good form. More
than one or two cowboys in the Rio Blanco country had
left their former homes just ahead of a sheriff.</p>
<p>Bandy Walker knew how to rope and ride. That was
the main consideration of Harshaw when he hired him.
He guessed the fellow&#8217;s name was not Walker any more
than it was Bandy. One cognomen had been given him
because he was so bow-legged; the other he had no doubt
taken for purposes of non-identification.</p>
<p>Bandy was short, heavy-set, and muscular. At a
glance one would have picked him out as dangerous.
The expression on the face was sulky. The eyes were
expressionless as jade.</p>
<p>He was given the bunk next Dillon and before twenty-four
hours were past he had begun to bully him. It began
with a surly request behind which Bob sensed a
command.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fellow, get my bridle, won&#8217;t you? I left it with my
saddle somewheres close to the chuck house. Got to fix
it to-night.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>Dillon had taken off his high-heeled boots because
they were hurting his feet. He observed that Walker,
lying fully dressed on the blankets, was still wearing his.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, sure,&#8221; Bob said amiably, and he tugged on his
boots.</p>
<p>Presently he returned with the bridle and handed it to
Bandy.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of it. Before the week was
out Bob was the man&#8217;s flunkey, the butt of his ill-natured
jokes, the helpless victim of his bad temper.
Inside, he writhed. Another failure was being scored
against him. But what could he do? This Bandy
Walker was a gunman and a rough-and-tumble fighter.
He boasted of it. Bob would be a child in his hands.</p>
<p>The other punchers watched the affair, drew deductions,
but made no audible comments. The law of the
outdoors is that every man must play his own hand.
The Slash Lazy D resented Bandy. He was ugly in face,
voice, and manner. His speech was offensive. He managed
to convey insult by the curl of his lip. Yet he was
cunning enough to keep within the bounds of safety.
Nobody wanted to pick a quarrel with him, for it might
turn out to be a serious business. The fellow looked rancorous.
Moreover, the ranch riders had no use for Dillon.
It would be a relief if Bandy drove him away. They felt
disgraced when cowboys from the Circle Bar or the
Quarter Circle Triangle inquired for the health of their
new rider Miss Roberta.</p>
<p>Dud and Bob were riding Milk Creek one day about
a week after Walker&#8217;s arrival. They unsaddled at noon
and lay down to loaf on a sunny bank close to the water&#8217;s
edge.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>Hollister had been silent all morning, contrary to his
usual custom. His good spirits usually radiated gayety.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? Ain&#8217;t you feelin&#8217; good?&#8221; Bob
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stomach?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heart,&#8221; returned Dud gloomily.</p>
<p>Bob sat up. &#8220;Why, I never heard there was anything
the matter with yore heart. If there is, you hadn&#8217;t
ought to be ridin&#8217; these crazy colts you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; the matter with <i>my</i> heart. It&#8217;s yore&#8217;s I&#8217;m
worryin&#8217; about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob flushed, but said nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wonderin&#8217; how long you&#8217;re aimin&#8217; to let that
bully puss fellow Walker run over you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What can I do?&#8221; Bob did not look at his companion.
He kept his eyes on the ground, where he was tracing
figures with a broken stick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s seve-re-al things you could do. You
might work the plug-ugly over. It couldn&#8217;t hurt his
looks none, an&#8217; it might improve &#8217;em. That&#8217;s one suggestion.
I&#8217;ve got others where that come from.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a bad actor. I expect he&#8217;d half kill me,&#8221; Bob
muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon he would, onless you beat him to it. That&#8217;s
not the point. You got to fight him or admit you&#8217;re
yellow. No two ways about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t fight. I never did,&#8221; groaned Dillon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then how do you know you can&#8217;t? If you can&#8217;t,
take yore lickin&#8217;. But you be on top of him every minute
of the time whilst you&#8217;re gettin&#8217; it. Go to it like a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
wild cat. Pretty soon something&#8217;ll drop, an&#8217; maybe it
won&#8217;t be you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dud&#8217;s blue eyes grew steely. &#8220;You can&#8217;t, eh? Listen,
fellow. I promised Blister to make a man outa
you if I could. I aim to do it. You lick Bandy good
to-night or I&#8217;ll whale you to-morrow. That ain&#8217;t all
either. Every time you let him run on you I&#8217;ll beat you
up next day soon as I get you alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob looked at him, startled. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t do that,
Dud?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t I? Don&#8217;t you bet I wouldn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m makin&#8217;
that promise right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were&mdash;my friend,&#8221; Bob faltered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it. I&#8217;m particular who I call by that
name. I ain&#8217;t a friend of any man without sand in his
gizzard. But I done give my word to Old Blister an&#8217; I
gotta come through. It&#8217;ll hurt you more&#8217;n it will me,
anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll quit an&#8217; leave this part of the country,&#8221; Bob
said wretchedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not stoppin&#8217; you, but you won&#8217;t go till I&#8217;ve
whopped you once good. Will you take it now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s talk it over reasonable,&#8221; Bob pleaded.</p>
<p>Dud looked disgusted. &#8220;I never see such a fellow for
thinkin&#8217; he could chin himself outa trouble. Nothin&#8217;
doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got no right to interfere in my affairs. It&#8217;s
not yore business,&#8221; the worried victim of circumstances
declared with an attempt at dignity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, don&#8217;t I know it? If I hadn&#8217;t promised Blister&mdash;But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
what&#8217;s the use? I done said I would, an&#8217; I
got to go through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you off yore promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dud shook his head. &#8220;Wish you could, but you can&#8217;t.
It was to Blister I give my word. No, sir. You gotta
take or give a lickin&#8217;, looks like. Either me or Bandy, I
ain&#8217;t particular which.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You lay off me, Dud Hollister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Honest, I hope you&#8217;ll fix it so&#8217;s I can. Well, you got
till to-morrow to decide. Don&#8217;t forget. Me or Bandy
one. You take yore choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t fight you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s Bandy. Suits me fine. Say, Bob, I ain&#8217;t so
darned sure that fellow&#8217;ll be there so big when it comes
to a show-down. He looks to me tricky rather than
game. Take him by surprise. Then crawl his hump sudden.
With which few well-chosen words I close. Yores
sincerely, Well-wisher, as these guys sign themselves
when they write to the papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>All through the rest of the day Bob was depressed.
He felt as cheerful as a man about to be hanged. Why
couldn&#8217;t they let him alone? He never in his life went
looking for trouble and it seemed to hunt him out if he
was anywhere in reach. It was not fair. What claim had
Dud to mix into his difficulties with Bandy? Absolutely
none.</p>
<p>He made up his mind to slip away in the night, ride to
Glenwood, and take the train for Denver. There a fellow
could live in peace.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>BOB CRAWLS HIS HUMP SUDDEN</h3>
</div>

<p>There was a game of stud after supper in the bunkhouse.
Bob lay on his bed, a prey to wretched dread. He had
made up his mind to have it out with Bandy, but his
heart was pumping water instead of blood. When he
looked at the squat puncher, thick-necked and leather-faced,
an ugly sneer on his lips, the courage died out of
his breast.</p>
<p>Dud was sitting with his back to the wall. His attention
was ostensibly on the game, but Bob knew he was
waiting for developments.</p>
<p>Bandy sat next Dud. &#8220;Raise you once,&#8221; he snarled.
His card-playing was like everything else he did, offensive
by reason of the spirit back of it. He was a bad
loser and a worse winner.</p>
<p>&#8220;And another blue,&#8221; said Hollister easily when it
came his turn again. &#8220;Got to treat an ace in the hole
with respect.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other two players dropped out, leaving only
Bandy to contest the pot with Dud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once more,&#8221; retorted the bow-legged puncher, shoving
in chips.</p>
<p>&#8220;And again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmp! Claim an ace in the hole, do you? Well, I&#8217;ll
jes&#8217; give it one more li&#8217;l&#8217; kick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hollister had showing a deuce of hearts, a trey of
clubs, an ace of spades, and a four of hearts. He might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
have a five in the hole or an ace. Bandy had a pair of
jacks in sight.</p>
<p>Dud called.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see it,&#8221; growled Bandy. &#8220;One pair.&#8221;</p>
<p>His opponent flipped over an ace of diamonds. &#8220;One
pair here&mdash;aces.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Knew it all the time. Yore play gave it away,&#8221;
jeered Bandy with obvious ill-temper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s why you kept raisin&#8217;,&#8221; Dud suggested,
raking in the pot.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I needed was to hook a jack or another pair to
beat you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I didn&#8217;t catch another ace or a small pair.&#8221;</p>
<p>The game was breaking up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell! I was playin&#8217; poker before you could navigate,
young fellow,&#8221; Bandy boasted. He had lost four dollars
and was annoyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you&#8217;re still an optimist about hookin&#8217; another
pair when you need &#8217;em.&#8221; Dud was counting his winnings
placidly. &#8220;Six-fifty&mdash;seven&mdash;seven and two
bits. Wish I had yore confidence in the music of the
spears workin&#8217; out so harmonious.&#8221;</p>
<p>This last was a reference to a book left at the ranch
recently by the Reverend Melancthon Browning, the
title of which was, &#8220;The Music of the Spheres.&#8221; Its
philosophy was that every man makes his own world
by the way he thinks about it.</p>
<p>Bandy jingled back to his bunk. He unstrapped his
spurs, hooked one foot behind the knee of the other leg,
and tried to work the wet boot off. The slippery leather
stuck.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>He called to Bob. &#8220;Come here, fellow, an&#8217; yank this
boot off for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dillon did not move. His heart stood still, then began
to race. A choking filled his throat. The hour was
striking for him. It was to be now or never.</p>
<p>The bow-legged puncher slewed his head. &#8220;I&#8217;m
talkin&#8217; to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly, reluctantly, Bob rose. He did not want to
move. Something stronger than his will lifted him out of
the bed and dragged him across the floor. He knew his
hands were trembling.</p>
<p>Malignant triumph rode in Bandy&#8217;s eye. It was always
safe to bully this timid youth. Dud Hollister had
a &#8220;No Trespass&#8221; sign displayed in his quiet, cool manner.
Very well. He would take it out of his riding mate.
That was one way of getting at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s ailin&#8217; you? Git a move on. You act like
you&#8217;d like to tell me to go take a walk. I&#8217;ll bet you
would, too, if you wasn&#8217;t such a rabbit heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob stooped and picked up the dirty boot. He zigzagged
it from the foot. As he straightened again his
eyes met those of Dud. He felt a roaring in the temples.</p>
<p>&#8220;O&#8217; course any one that&#8217;d let another fellow take his
wife from him&mdash;an&#8217; him not married more&#8217;n an hour
or two&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The young fellow did not hear the end of the cruel
gibe. The sound of rushing waters filled his ears. He
pulled off the second boot.</p>
<p>Again his gaze met that of Hollister. He remembered
Dud&#8217;s words. &#8220;Crawl his hump sudden. Go to it like a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
wild cat.&#8221; The trouble was he couldn&#8217;t. His muscles
would not obey the flaccid will.</p>
<p>The flood of waters died down. The roaring ceased.
The puncher&#8217;s words came to him clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;... not but what she was likely glad enough to go
with Jake. She was out with him four-five hours.
Where was they, I ask? What was they doing? You
can&#8217;t tell me she couldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; got away sooner if she&#8217;d
wanted to so darned bad. No, sir, I&#8217;m no chicken right
out of a shell. When it comes to a woman I say, Where&#8217;s
the man?&#8221;</p>
<p>A surge of anger welled up in Dillon and overflowed.
He forgot about Dud and his threats. He forgot about
his trepidation. This hound was talking of June, lying
about her out of his foul throat.</p>
<p>One of the boots was still in his hand. He swung it
round and brought the heel hard against the fellow&#8217;s
mouth. The blood gushed from the crushed lips. Bob
dropped the boot and jolted his left to the cheek. He
followed with a smashing right to the eye.</p>
<p>Taken at disadvantage, Bandy tried to struggle to his
feet. He ran into one straight from the shoulder that
caught the bridge of his nose and flung him back upon
the bunk.</p>
<p>His hand reached under the pillow. Bob guessed what
was there and dropped hard with both knees on his
stomach.</p>
<p>The breath went out of Bandy suddenly. He lay still
for a moment. When he began to struggle again he had
forgotten the revolver under the pillow. With a sweeping
gesture Bob brushed pillow and gun to the floor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>The man underneath twisted his red, wrinkled neck
and bit Bob&#8217;s forearm savagely. The boy&#8217;s fingers
closed like a vice on the hairy throat and tightened. His
other fist beat a merciless tattoo on the bruised and
bleeding face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take him off!&#8221; Bandy presently gasped.</p>
<p>Dud appointed himself referee. With difficulty he unloosed
the fingers embedded in the flesh of the throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Had enough, Bandy? You licked?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take him off, I tell you!&#8221; the man managed to
scream.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless you&#8217;re whipped. How about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Nough,&#8221; the bully groaned.</p>
<p>Bob observed that Hawks had taken charge of the
revolver. He released Walker.</p>
<p>The bow-legged puncher sat at the side of the bed and
coughed. The blood was streaming from a face bruised
and cut in a dozen places.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&mdash;he&mdash;jumped me&mdash;when I wasn&#8217;t lookin&#8217;,&#8221;
the cowboy spat out, a word at a time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t pull an alibi, Bandy. You had it comin&#8217;,&#8221;
Dud said with a grin. He was more pleased than he
could tell.</p>
<p>Dillon felt as though something not himself had taken
control of him. He was in a cold fury, ready to fight
again at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said she&mdash;she&mdash;&#8221; The sentence broke, but
Bob rushed into another. &#8220;He&#8217;s got to take it back or
I&#8217;ll kill him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only the first round ended, looks like, Bandy,&#8221; Dud
said genially. &#8220;You better be lookin&#8217; this time when he
comes at you, or he&#8217;ll sure eat you alive.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not lookin&#8217; for no fight,&#8221; Bandy said sulkily,
dabbing at his face with the bandanna round his neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you ain&#8217;t&mdash;not with a catamount like Miss
Roberta here,&#8221; Tom Reeves said, chuckling with delight.</p>
<p>One idea still obsessed Bob&#8217;s consciousness. &#8220;What
he said about June&mdash;I&#8217;ll not let him get away with it.
He&#8217;s got to tell you-all he was lyin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You hear yore boss speak, Bandy,&#8221; drawled Dud.
&#8220;How about it? Do we get to see you massacreed again?
Or do you stand up an&#8217; admit you&#8217;re a dirty liar for
talkin&#8217; thataway?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bandy Walker looked round on a circle of faces all unfriendly
to him. He had broken the code, and he knew
it. In the outdoor West a man does not slander a good
woman without the chance of having to pay for it. The
puncher had let his bad bullying temper run away with
him. He had done it because he had supposed Dillon
harmless, to vent on him the spleen he could not safely
empty upon Dud Hollister&#8217;s blond head.</p>
<p>If Bob had been alone the bow-legged man might
have taken a chance&mdash;though it is doubtful whether he
would have invited that whirlwind attack again, unless
he had had a revolver close at hand&mdash;but he knew
public sentiment was wholly against him. There was
nothing to do but to swallow his words.</p>
<p>That he did this in the most ungracious way possible
was like him. &#8220;Since you&#8217;re runnin&#8217; a Sunday School
outfit I&#8217;ll pack my roll an&#8217; move on to-morrow to where
there&#8217;s some he-men,&#8221; he sneered. &#8220;I never met this
girl, so I don&#8217;t know a thing about her. All I did was to
make a general remark about women. Which same I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
know to be true. But since you&#8217;re a bunch of sky pilots
at the Slash Lazy D, I&#8217;ll withdraw anything that hurts
yore tender feelin&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you takin&#8217; back what you said&mdash;about&mdash;about
her?&#8221; Bob demanded harshly.</p>
<p>Bandy&#8217;s smouldering, sullen eyes slid round. &#8220;I&#8217;m
takin&#8217; it back. Didn&#8217;t you hear me say I don&#8217; know a
thing about her? I know Houck, though. So I judged&mdash;&#8221;
He spat a loose tooth out on the floor venomously. It
would perhaps not be wise to put into words what he
had deduced from his knowledge of Jake Houck.</p>
<p>&#8220;The incident is now clo-o-sed if Miss Roberta is satisfied,&#8221;
Dud announced to the public at large.</p>
<p>His riding mate looked at Hollister. &#8220;Don&#8217;t call me
that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>For a moment Dud was puzzled. &#8220;Don&#8217;t call you
what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you just called me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dud broke into a grin of delight. He wondered if
it would not be a good idea to make Bob give him a
licking, too. But he decided to let good enough alone.
He judged that Blister would be satisfied without any
more gore. Anyhow, Bob might weaken and spoil it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boy, I&#8217;ll never call you Miss&mdash;what I called you&mdash;long
as I live exceptin&#8217; when I&#8217;m meanin&#8217; to compliment
you special.&#8221; Dud slapped him hard between the
shoulder blades. &#8220;You&#8217;re a young cyclone, but you
can&#8217;t get a chance to muss Dud Hollister up to-night.
You work too rapid. Doggone my hide, if I ever did see
a faster or a better piece o&#8217; work. How about it, Tom?&#8221;</p>
<p>Reeves, too, pounded Dillon in token of friendship. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
Bob had not wiped the slate clean he had made a start
in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re some scrapper when you get started. Bandy
looks like he&#8217;s been through a railroad wreck,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Bandy was by this time at the wash-basin repairing
damages. &#8220;Tell you he jumped me when I wasn&#8217;t
lookin&#8217;,&#8221; he growled sulkily. &#8220;Fine business. You-all
stood by an&#8217; watched him do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After you&#8217;d deviled him for a week,&#8221; amended Big
Bill. &#8220;Mebbe in that outfit of he-men you&#8217;re expectin&#8217;
to hit the trail for to-morrow they&#8217;ll wrop you up in cotton
an&#8217; not let a hundred-an&#8217;-thirty-pound giant jump
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t askin&#8217; it of &#8217;em,&#8221; Bandy retorted. &#8220;I can
look out for myself an&#8217; then some. As for this sprout
who thinks he&#8217;s so gosh-mighty, I&#8217;ll jus&#8217; say one thing.
Some o&#8217; these days I&#8217;ll settle with him proper.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned as he spoke. The look on his battered face
was venomous.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>IN THE SADDLE</h3>
</div>

<p>White winter covered the sage hills and gave the country
a bleak and desolate look. The Slash Lazy D riders
wrapped up and went out over the wind-swept mesas to
look after the cattle cowering in draws or drifting with
the storm. When Bob could sleep snugly in the bunkhouse
he was lucky. There were nights when he shivered
over a pine-knot fire in the shelter of a cutbank with the
temperature fifteen degrees below zero.</p>
<p>At this work he won the respect of his fellows. He
could set his teeth and endure discomfort with any of
them. It was at sharp danger crises that he had always
quailed. He never shirked work or hardship, and he
never lied to make the way easier or more comfortable.
Harshaw watched him with increasing approval. In
Dillon he found all but one of the essential virtues of the
cowboy&mdash;good humor, fidelity, truth, tenacity, and
industry. If he lacked courage in the face of peril the
reason was no doubt a constitutional one.</p>
<p>A heavy storm in February tried the riders to capacity.
They were in the saddle day and night. For weeks
they appeared at the ranch only at odd intervals, haggard,
unshaven, hungry as wolves. They ate, saddled
fresh mounts, and went out into the drifts again tireless
and indomitable.</p>
<p>Except for such food as they could carry in a sack
they lived on elk trapped in the deep snow. The White
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
River country was one of the two or three best big
game districts in the United States.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The early settlers
could get a deer whenever they wanted one. Many were
shot from the doors of their cabins.</p>
<p>While Harshaw, Dud, and Bob were working Wolf
Creek another heavy snow fell. A high wind swept the
white blanket into deep drifts. All day the riders
ploughed through these to rescue gaunt and hungry
cattle. Night caught them far from the cabin where
they had been staying.</p>
<p>They held a consultation. It was bitter weather, the
wind still blowing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have to camp, looks like,&#8221; Harshaw said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have a mighty tough night without grub and
blankets,&#8221; Dud said doubtfully. &#8220;She&#8217;s gettin&#8217; colder
every minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a sheltered draw below here. We&#8217;ll get a
good fire going anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the gulch they found a band of elk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s our supper an&#8217; our beds,&#8221; Dud said.</p>
<p>They killed three.</p>
<p>While Bob gathered and chopped up a down and
dead tree the others skinned the game. There was dry
wood in Harshaw&#8217;s saddle-bags with which to start a
fire. Soon Dillon had a blaze going which became a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
crackling, roaring furnace. They ate a supper of broiled
venison without trimmings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might be a heap worse,&#8221; Dud said while he was
smoking afterward before the glowing pine knots. &#8220;I&#8217;m
plenty warm in front even if I&#8217;m about twenty below
up an&#8217; down my spine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently they rolled up in the green hides and fell
asleep.</p>
<p>None of them slept very comfortably. The night was
bitter, and they found it impossible to keep warm.</p>
<p>Bob woke first. He decided to get up and replenish
with fuel the fire. He could not rise. The hide had
frozen stiff about him. He shouted to the others.</p>
<p>They, too, were helpless in the embrace of their improvised
sleeping-bags.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have to roll to the fire an&#8217; thaw out,&#8221; Harshaw suggested.</p>
<p>This turned out to be a ticklish job. They had to get
close enough to scorch their faces and yet not near
enough to set fire to the robes. More than once Bob
rolled over swiftly to put out a blaze in the snow.</p>
<p>Dud was the first to step out of his blanket. In a minute
or two he had peeled the hides from the others.</p>
<p>An hour later they were floundering through the drifts
toward the cabin on Wolf Creek. Behind each rider was
strapped the carcass of an elk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reminds me of the time Blister went snow blind,&#8221;
Harshaw said. &#8220;Up around Badger Bend it was. He
got lost an&#8217; wandered around for a coupla days blind as a
bat. Finally old Clint Frazer&#8217;s wife seen him wallowin&#8217;
in the drifts an&#8217; the old man brought him in. They was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
outa grub an&#8217; had to hoof it to town. Clint yoked his
bull team an&#8217; had it break trail. He an&#8217; the wife followed.
But Blister he couldn&#8217;t see, so he had to hang on to one
o&#8217; the bulls by the tail. The boys joshed him about that
quite a while. He ce&#8217;tainly was a sight rollin&#8217; down
Main Street anchored to that critter&#8217;s tail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet Blister was glad to put his foot on the rail at
Dolan&#8217;s,&#8221; Dud murmured. &#8220;I&#8217;d be kinda glad to do
that same my own se&#8217;f right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blister went to bed and stayed there for a spell. He
was a sick man.&#8221; Harshaw&#8217;s eye caught sight of some
black specks on a distant hillside. &#8220;Cattle. We&#8217;ll come
back after we&#8217;ve onloaded at the cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>They did. It was long after dark before they reached
shelter again.</p>
<p>The riders of the Slash Lazy D were glad to see spring
come, though it brought troubles of its own. The
weather turned warm and stayed so. The snow melted
faster than the streams could take care of it. There was
high water all over the Blanco country. The swollen
creeks poured down into the overflowing river. Three
punchers in the valley were drowned inside of a week,
for that was before the bridges had been built.</p>
<p>While the water was still high Harshaw started a trail
herd to Utah.</p>

<p style='font-size: small'>According to old-timers the automobile is responsible for the extermination of the game supply going on so rapidly. The pioneers at certain seasons provided for their needs by killing blacktail and salting down the meat. But they were dead shots and expert hunters. The automobile tourists with high-power rifles rush into the hills during the open season and kill male and female without distinction. For every deer killed outright three or four crawl away to die later from wounds. One ranchman reports finding fifteen dead deer on one day&#8217;s travel through the sage.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>THE RIO BLANCO PUTS IN A CLAIM</h3>
</div>

<p>Preparations for the drive occupied several days. The
cattle were rounded up and carefully worked. Many of
those that had roughed through the hard winter were
still weak. Some of these would yet succumb and would
increase the thirty per cent of losses already counted.
Only those able to stand inspection were thrown into the
trail herd. Afterward, a second cut was made and any
doubtful ones culled from the bunch.</p>
<p>Word had come from Rangely that all the streams
were high as far as and beyond the Utah line. But the
owner of the Slash Lazy D was under contract to deliver
and he could not wait for the water to go down.</p>
<p>When the road herd had been selected and the mavericks
in the round-up branded with the Slash Lazy D or whatever
other brand seemed fair considering the physical
characteristics of the animal and the group with
which it was ranging, Harshaw had the cattle moved up
the river a couple of miles to a valley of good grass.
Here they were held while the ranch hands busied themselves
with preparations for the journey. A wagon and
harness were oiled, a chuck-box built, and a supply of
groceries packed. Bridles and cinches were gone over
carefully, ropes examined, and hobbles prepared.</p>
<p>The remuda for the trail outfit was chosen by Harshaw
himself. He knew his horses as he knew the trail to
Bear Cat. No galled back or lame leg could escape his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
keen eye. No half-tamed outlaw could slip into the
cavvy. Every horse chosen was of proved stamina. Any
known to be afraid of water remained at the ranch.
Every rider would have to swim streams a dozen times
and his safety would depend upon his mount. Tails
were thinned, hoofs trimmed, manes cleared of witches&#8217;
bridles, and ears swabbed to free them of ticks.</p>
<p>The start was made before dawn. Stars were shining
by thousands when the chuck-wagon rolled down the
road. The blatting of cows could be heard as the riders
moved the phantom cattle from their bedding-ground.</p>
<p>The dogies were long-legged and shaggy, agile and
wild as deer. They were small-boned animals, not fit
for market until they were four-year-olds. On their
gaunt frames was little meat, but they were fairly strong
and very voracious. If not driven too hard these horned
jackrabbits, as some wag had dubbed them, would take
on flesh rapidly.</p>
<p>Harshaw chose five punchers to go with him&mdash;Dud,
Big Bill, Tom Reeves, Hawks, and Bob. A light mess-wagon
went with the outfit. Before noon the herd had
grazed five miles down the river.</p>
<p>The young grass matted the ground. Back of the
valley could be seen the greenclad mesas stretching to
the foothills which hemmed in the Rio Blanco. The
timber and the mesquite were in leaf. Wild roses and
occasionally bluebells bloomed. The hillsides were white
with the blossoms of service berries.</p>
<p>In the early afternoon they reached the ford. Harshaw
trailed the cattle across in a long file. He watched
the herd anxiously, for the stream was running strong
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
from the freshet. After a short, hard swim the animals
made the landing.</p>
<p>The mess-wagon rattled down to the ford as the last
of the herd scrambled ashore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think I&#8217;ll put you at the reins, Dud,&#8221; the cattleman
said. &#8220;Head the horses upstream a little and keep &#8217;em
going.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the other punchers except Bob were across the
river with the herd.</p>
<p>Dud relieved the previous driver, gathered up reins
and whip with competent hands, and put the horses at
the river. They waded in through the shallows, breasted
the deep water, and began to swim. Before they had
gone three yards they were in difficulties. The force of
the current carried the light wagon downstream. The
whiplash cracked around the ears of the horses, but they
could not make headway. Team, wagon, and driver began
to drift down the river. Supplies, floating from the
top of the load, were scattered in all directions.</p>
<p>Instantly six men became very busy. Rope loops flew
out and tightened around the bed of the wagon. Others
circled the necks of the horses. Dud dived into the river
to lighten the load. Harshaw, Bob, and the cook rode
into the shallow water and salvaged escaping food, while
the riders on the other bank guided wagon and team
ashore.</p>
<p>Dud, dripping like a mermaid, came to land with a
grin. Under one arm a pasty sack of flour was tucked,
under the other a smoked venison haunch. &#8220;An&#8217; I took
a bath only yesterday,&#8221; he lamented.</p>
<p>The food was sun-dried and the wagon repacked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>At Dry Creek, which was now a rushing torrent, Harshaw
threw the cattle into a draw green with young
grass and made camp for the night.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got neighbors,&#8221; announced Big Bill, watching
a thin column of smoke rising from the mesa back of
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll drift over after supper,&#8221; Harshaw said.
&#8220;Maybe they can give me the latest news about high
water down the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hawks had just come in from the remuda. He gave
information.</p>
<p>&#8220;I drifted over to their camp. An old friend, one of
&#8217;em. Gent by the name of Bandy Walker. He&#8217;s found
that outfit of he-men he was lookin&#8217; for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the cattleman non-committally.</p>
<p>&#8220;One&#8217;s a stranger. The other&#8217;s another old friend of
some o&#8217; the boys. Jake Houck he calls hisself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s heart shriveled within him. Two enemies
scarcely a stone&#8217;s throw away, and probably both of
them knew he was here. Had they come to settle with
him?</p>
<p>He dismissed this last fear. In Jake Houck&#8217;s scheme
of things he was not important enough to call for a
special trip of vengeance.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll leave &#8217;em alone,&#8221; Harshaw decided. &#8220;If any of
them drop over we&#8217;ll be civil. No trouble, boys, you
understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Houck&#8217;s party did not show up, and before break
of day the camp of the trail herd outfit was broken. The
riders moved the herd up the creek to an open place
where it could be easily crossed. From here the cattle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
drifted back toward the river. Dud was riding on the
point, Hawks and Dillon on the drag.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon a gulch obstructed their path.
It ran down at right angles to the Rio Blanco. Along the
edge of this Harshaw rode till he found an easier descent.
He drove the leaders into the ravine and started them up
the other side of the trough to the mesa beyond. The
cattle crowded so close that some of them were forced
down the bed of the gorge instead of up the opposite
bank.</p>
<p>Bob galloped along the edge and tried to head the
animals back by firing his revolver in front from above.
In this he was not successful. The gulch was narrow,
and the pressure behind drove the foremost cattle on to
the river.</p>
<p>The dogies waded in to drink. The push of the rear
still impelled the ones in advance to move deeper into the
water. Presently the leaders were swimming out into
the stream. Those behind followed at heel.</p>
<p>Dillon flung his horse down into the ravine in the
headlong fashion he had learned from months of hill
riding. He cantered along it, splashing through shallow
pools and ploughing into tangled brush. When he came
within sight of the river the cattle were emerging from it
upon a sandy bar that formed an island in midstream.</p>
<p>He kicked off his chaps, remounted, and headed into
the water. The current was strong and Powder River
already tired. But the bronco breasted the rushing
waters gamely. It was swept downstream, fighting
every inch of the way. When at last the Wyoming horse
touched bottom, it was at the lower edge of the long bar.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>Bob swung down into the water and led his mount
ashore.</p>
<p>From the bank he had just left, Hawks called to him.
&#8220;Want I should come over, or can you handle &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better stay there till I see if I can start &#8217;em back,&#8221;
Bob shouted.</p>
<p>On Powder River he rounded up the cattle, a score or
more of them, and drove them back into the stream.
They went reluctantly, for they too were tired and the
swim across had been a hard one. But after one or two
had started the others followed.</p>
<p>The young cowpuncher did not like the look of the
black rushing waters. He had known one horrible moment
of terror while he was crossing, that moment during
which he had been afraid Powder River would be
swept beyond the point of the sand spit. Now he
cringed at the thought of venturing into that flood again.
He postponed the hazard, trying two or three starting-places
tentatively before he selected one at the extreme
upper point of the island.</p>
<p>His choice was a bad one. The bronco was carried
down into a swirl of deep, angry water. So swift was the
undertow that Powder River was dragged from beneath
its rider. Bob caught at the mane of the horse and clung
desperately to it with one hand. A second or two, and
this was torn from his clutch.</p>
<p>Dillon was washed downstream. He went under,
tried to cry for help, and swallowed several gulps of
water. When he came to the surface again he was still
close to the island, buffeted by the boiling torrent. It
swept him to a bar of willow bushes. To these he clung
with the frenzy of a drowning man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>After a time he let go one hand-hold and found another.
Gradually he worked into the shallows and to
land. He could see Powder River, far downstream, still
fighting impotently against the pressure of the current.</p>
<p>Bob shuddered. If he lived a hundred years he would
never have a closer escape from drowning. It gave him
a dreadful sinking at the stomach even to look at the
plunging Blanco. The river was like some fearful monster
furiously seeking to devour.</p>
<p>The voice of Hawks came to him. &#8220;Stay there while
I get the boss.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dismounted cowboy watched Hawks ride away,
then lay down in the hot sand and let the sun bake him.
He felt sick and weak, as helpless as a blind and wobbly
pup.</p>
<p>It may have been an hour later that he heard voices
and looked across to the mouth of the ravine. Harshaw
and Big Bill and Dud were there with Hawks. They
were in a group working with ropes.</p>
<p>Harshaw rode into the river. He carried a coil of rope.
Evidently two or more lariats had been tied together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out far as you can and catch this rope when I
throw it,&#8221; Harshaw told the marooned cowboy.</p>
<p>Bob ventured out among the willows, wading very
carefully to make sure of his footing. The current
swirled around his thighs and tugged at him.</p>
<p>The cattleman flung the rope. It fell short. He pulled
it in and rewound the coil. This time he drove his horse
into deeper water. The animal was swimming when the
loop sailed across to the willows.</p>
<p>Dillon caught it, slipped it over his body, and drew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
the noose tight. A moment later he was being tossed
about by the cross-currents. The lariat tightened. He
was dragged under as the force of the torrent flung him
into midstream. His body was racked by conflicting
forces tugging at it. He was being torn in two, the victim
of a raging battle going on to possess him. Now he
was on his face, now on his back. For an instant he
caught a glimpse of blue sunlit sky before he plunged
down again into the black waters and was engulfed by
them....</p>
<p>He opened his eyes. Dud&#8217;s voice came from a long
way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Comin&#8217; to all right. Didn&#8217;t I tell you this bird
couldn&#8217;t drown?&#8221;</p>
<p>The mists cleared. Bob saw Dud&#8217;s cheerful smile, and
back of it the faces of Harshaw, Hawks, and Big Bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got me out,&#8221; he murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure did, Bob. You&#8217;re some drookit, but I reckon
we can dry you like we did the grub,&#8221; his riding mate
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who got me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blame the boss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We all took a hand, boy,&#8221; Harshaw explained. &#8220;It
was quite some job. You were headed for Utah right
swift. The boys rode in and claimed ownership. How
you feelin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; Bob answered, and he tried to demonstrate
by rising.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on. What&#8217;s yore rush?&#8221; Harshaw interrupted.
&#8220;You&#8217;re right dizzy, I expect. A fellow can&#8217;t swallow
the Blanco and feel like kickin&#8217; a hole in the sky right
away. Take yore time, boy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>Bob remembered his mount. &#8220;Powder River got
away from me&mdash;in the water.&#8221; He said it apologetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not blamin&#8217; you for that,&#8221; the boss said, and
laid a kindly hand on Dillon&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it drowned?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;ll find that out later. Lucky you wasn&#8217;t.
That&#8217;s a heap more important.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob was riding behind Dud fifteen minutes later in
the wake of the herd. Hawks had gone back to learn
what had become of Powder River.</p>
<p>Supper was ready when Buck reached camp. He was
just in time to hear the cook&#8217;s &#8220;Come an&#8217; get it.&#8221; He
reported to Harshaw.</p>
<p>&#8220;Horse got outa the river about a mile below the island.
I scouted around some for it, but couldn&#8217;t trail
in the dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Buck. To-morrow Dud and Bob can ride
back and get the bronc. We&#8217;ll loaf along the trail and
make a short day of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat down on his heels, reached for a tin plate and
cup, and began one of the important duties of the day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>CUTTING SIGN</h3>
</div>

<p>Dud&#8217;s observation, when he and Bob took the back
trail along the river to find the missing bronco, confirmed
that of Buck Hawks. He found the place where a
horse had clawed its way out of the stream to the clay
bank. From here it had wandered into the sage and
turned toward the home ranch. The tracks showed that
Powder River was moving slowly, grazing as it went.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon by noon we can say &#8216;Hello!&#8217; to yore bronc,&#8221;
Dud prophesied. &#8220;No need to trail it. All we got to do
is follow the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>An hour later he drew up and swung from the saddle.
&#8220;Now I wonder who we&#8217;ve had with us this glad
mawnin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dud stooped and examined carefully tracks in the
mud. Bob joined him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Powder River ain&#8217;t so lonesome now. Met up with
friends, looks like. Takin&#8217; a li&#8217;l&#8217; journey north.&#8221; The
cowpuncher&#8217;s blue eyes sparkled. The prosaic pursuit of
a stray mount had of a sudden become Adventure.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do <i>you</i> read from this sign we&#8217;ve cut?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob told his deductions. &#8220;Powder River met some
one on horseback. The man got off. Here&#8217;s his tracks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fellow, use yore haid,&#8221; admonished his friend.
&#8220;Likewise yore eyes. You wouldn&#8217;t say this track was
made by the same man as this one, would you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. It&#8217;s bigger.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; here&#8217;s another, all wore off at the heel. We got
three men anyhow. Which means also three horses.
Point of fact there are four mounts, one to carry the
pack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know there are four?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They had four when they camped close to us night
&#8217;fore last.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dillon felt a sinking at the pit of his stomach. &#8220;You
think this is Houck&#8217;s outfit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;d be my guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; that they&#8217;ve taken Powder River with them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m doing better than guessin&#8217; about that. One of
the party saw a bronc with an empty saddle an&#8217; tried to
rope it. First time he missed, but he made good when he
tried again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had yore imagination, Dud&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Straight goods. See here where the loop of the rope
dragged along the top of the mud after the fellow missed
his throw.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob saw the evidence after it had been pointed out to
him. &#8220;But that don&#8217;t prove he got Powder River next
time he threw,&#8221; he protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s where that&#8217;s proved.&#8221; Dud showed him the
impressions of two hoofs dug deep into the ground.
&#8220;Powder River bucked after he was roped an&#8217; tried to
break away. The other horse, like any good cowpony
does, leaned back on the rope an&#8217; dug a toe-hold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Houck going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Brown&#8217;s Park likely, from the way they&#8217;re headed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, drap in on them to-night kinda casual an&#8217; say
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
&#8216;Much obliged for roundin&#8217; up our stray bronc for us.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>This programme did not appeal to Bob. In that camp
were two enemies of his. Both of them also hated Dud.
Houck and Walker were vindictive. It was not likely
either of them would forget what they owed these two
young fellows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;d better ride back an&#8217; tell the boss first,&#8221;
he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;d better not,&#8221; Hollister dissented. &#8220;By
that time they&#8217;d be so far ahead we&#8217;d never catch &#8217;em.
No, sir. We&#8217;ll leave a note here for the boss. Tack it to
this cottonwood. If we don&#8217;t show up in a reasonable
time he&#8217;ll trail back an&#8217; find out what for not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;d do us a lot of good if Houck had dry-gulched
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dud laughed. &#8220;You&#8217;re the lad with the imagination.
Far as Houck goes, an&#8217; Bandy Walker, too, for that
matter, I&#8217;ll make you a present of the pair of &#8217;em as two
sure-enough bad eggs. But they&#8217;ve got to play the hands
dealt &#8217;em without knowin&#8217; what we&#8217;re holdin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve prob&#8217;ly got rifles, an&#8217; we haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a cinch they&#8217;ve got rifles. But they won&#8217;t dare
use &#8217;em. How do they know we&#8217;re playin&#8217; this alone?
First off, I&#8217;ll mention that I sent Buck back to tell the
boss we&#8217;d taken the trail after them. That puts it up to
them to act reasonable whether they want to or not.
Another thing. We surprise &#8217;em. Give the birds no
chance to talk it over. Not knowin&#8217; what to do, they
do nothing. Ain&#8217;t that good psycho-ology, as Blister
says when he calls a busted flush?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trouble is we&#8217;re holdin&#8217; the busted flush.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, an&#8217; Houck&#8217;ll figure we wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; trailed
him unless we&#8217;d fixed the play right beforehand. His
horse sense will tell him we wouldn&#8217;t go that strong unless
our cards was all blue. We&#8217;re sittin&#8217; in the golden
chair. O&#8217; course we&#8217;ll give the birds a chance to save
their faces&mdash;make it plain that we&#8217;re a whole lot
obliged to &#8217;em for lookin&#8217; after Powder River for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s sagging head went up. He had remembered
Blister&#8217;s injunction. &#8220;All right, Dud. Turn yore wolf
loose. I&#8217;ll ride along an&#8217; back the bluff.&#8221;</p>
<p>They left the river and climbed to the mesa. The
trail took them through a rough country of sagebrush
into the hills of greasewood and piñon. In mid-afternoon
they shot a couple of grouse scuttling through the bunch
grass. Now and again they started deer, but they were
not looking for meat. A brown bear peered at them
from a thicket and went crashing away with an awkward
gait that carried it over the ground fast.</p>
<p>From a summit they saw before them a thin spiral of
smoke rising out of an arroyo.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s the end of the trail,&#8221; Dud drawled.
&#8220;We&#8217;re real pleased to meet up with you, Mr. Houck.
Last time I had the pleasure was a sorta special picnic in
yore honor. You was ridin&#8217; a rail outa Bear Cat an&#8217;
being jounced up considerable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he thinks of that&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll think of it,&#8221; Dud cut in cheerfully. &#8220;He&#8217;s
gritted his teeth a lot of times over that happenstance,
Mr. Houck has. It tastes right bitter in his mouth
every time he recollects it. First off, soon as he sees us,
he&#8217;ll figure that his enemies have been delivered into his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
hand. It&#8217;ll be up to us to change his mind. If you&#8217;re all
set, Sure-Shot, we&#8217;ll drift down an&#8217; start the peace talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob moistened his dry lips. &#8220;All set.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode down the hillside, topped another rise, and
descended into the draw where a camp was pitched.</p>
<p>A young fellow chopping firewood moved forward to
meet them.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Powder River with the broncs,&#8221; Bob said in
a low voice to his friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dud, and he swung from the saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Lo, fellows. Where you headed for?&#8221; the wood-chopper
asked amiably.</p>
<p>Two men were sitting by the fire. They waited, in an
attitude of listening. Dusk had fallen. The glow of the
fire lighted their faces, but the men who had just ridden
up were in the gathering darkness beyond the circle lit
by the flames.</p>
<p>&#8220;We came to get Powder River, the bronc you
rounded up for us,&#8221; Hollister said evenly. &#8220;Harshaw
sent us ahead. We&#8217;re sure much obliged to you for yore
trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>The larger of the two men by the fire rose and straddled
forward. He looked at Dud and he looked at Bob.
His face was a map of conflicting emotions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harshaw sent you, did he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Bob had bad luck in the river an&#8217; the horse
got away from him. I reckon the pony was lightin&#8217; out
for home when yore rope stopped the journey.&#8221; The
voice of Dud was cheerful and genial. It ignored any
little differences of the past with this hook-nosed individual
whose eyes were so sultry and passionate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So he sent you two fellows, did he? I&#8217;ll say he&#8217;s a
good picker. I been wantin&#8217; to meet you,&#8221; he said
harshly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Same here, Houck.&#8221; Bandy Walker pushed to the
front, jerking a forty-five from its scabbard.</p>
<p>Houck&#8217;s hand shot forward and caught the cowpuncher
by the wrist. &#8220;What&#8217;s bitin&#8217; you, Bandy?
Time enough for that when I give the word.&#8221;</p>
<p>The yellow teeth of the bow-legged man showed in a
snarl of rage and pain. &#8220;I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; got Dillon if you&#8217;d let
me be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you hear this guy say Harshaw sent them
here? Use yore horse sense, man.&#8221; Houck turned to
Hollister. &#8220;Yore bronc&#8217;s with the others. The saddle&#8217;s
over by that rock. Take &#8217;em an&#8217; hit the trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>In sullen rage Houck watched Dud saddle and cinch.
Not till the Slash Lazy D riders were ready to go did he
speak again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell you what I&#8217;ll do,&#8221; he proposed. &#8220;Get down
off&#8217;n yore horses, both o&#8217; you, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll whale the daylight
outa the pair of you. Bandy&#8217;ll stay where he&#8217;s at
an&#8217; not mix in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hollister looked at Bandy, and he knew the fellow&#8217;s
trigger finger itched. There was not a chance in the
world that he would stand back and play fair. But that
was not the reason why Dud declined the invitation.
He had not come to get into trouble. He meant to keep
out of it if he could.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last fellow that licked me hauled me down off&#8217;n my
bronc, Mr. Houck,&#8221; Dud answered, laughing. &#8220;No, sir.
We got to turn down that invite to a whalin&#8217;. The boss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
gave us our orders straight. No trouble a-tall. I expect
if it was our own say-so we might accommodate you.
But not the way things are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No guts, either of you. Ain&#8217;t two to one good
enough?&#8221; jeered Houck angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not good enough right now. Maybe some other
time, Mr. Houck,&#8221; Dud replied, his temper unruffled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want it to be twelve to one, like it was last
time, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harshaw will be lookin&#8217; for us, so we&#8217;ll be sayin&#8217;
good-evenin&#8217;,&#8221; the rider for the Slash Lazy D said
quietly.</p>
<p>He turned his horse to go, as did his companion.
Houck cursed them both bitterly. While they rode into
the gloom Bob&#8217;s heart lifted to his throat. Goosequills
ran up and down his spine. Would one of his enemies
shoot him in the back? He could hardly keep from
swinging his head to make sure they were not aiming at
him. He wanted to touch his mount with a spur to
quicken the pace.</p>
<p>But Dud, riding by his side, held his bronco to the
slow even road gait of the traveler who has many miles
to cover. Apparently he had forgotten the existence of
the furious, bitter men who were watching their exit
from the scene. Bob set his teeth and jogged along
beside him.</p>
<p>Not till they were over the hill did either of them
speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221; grunted Dud as he wiped the sweat from his
face. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure enough glad to have that job done with.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
My back aches right between the shoulder blades where
a bullet might &#8217;a&#8217; hit it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob relaxed in the saddle. He felt suddenly faint.
Even now he found himself looking round apprehensively
to make sure that a man carrying a rifle was not
silhouetted on the hilltop against the sky-line.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>PARTNERS IN PERIL</h3>
</div>

<p>Into the office of Blister Haines, J. P., a young man
walked. He was a berry-brown youth, in the trappings
of the range-rider, a little thin and stringy, perhaps, but
well-poised and light-stepping.</p>
<p>With one swift glance the fat man swept his visitor
from head to foot and liked what he saw. The lean face
was tanned, the jaw firm, the eye direct and steady.
There was no need to tell this man to snap up his head.
Eight months astride a saddle in the sun and wind had
wrought a change in Robert Dillon.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Lo, Red Haid,&#8221; the justice sang out squeakily.
&#8220;How&#8217;s yore good health? I heerd you was d-drowned.
Is you is, or is you ain&#8217;t? Sit down an&#8217; rest yore weary
bones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I took a swim,&#8221; admitted Bob. &#8220;The boys fished
me out while I was still kickin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rivers all high?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so high as they were. We noticed quite a difference
on the way back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, s-sit down an&#8217; tell me all about it. How do you
like ridin&#8217;, Texas man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like it fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All yore troubles blown away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of &#8217;em. I&#8217;m a long way from being a wolf yet,
though.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So? B-by the way, there&#8217;s a friend of yours in
town&mdash;Jake Houck.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a moment&#8217;s pause. &#8220;Did he say he was
my friend?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t mention it. Thought maybe you&#8217;d like to
know he&#8217;s here. It&#8217;s not likely he&#8217;ll trouble you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be glad to be sure of that. Dud an&#8217; I had a little
run-in with him last month. He wasn&#8217;t hardly in a
position then to rip loose, seein&#8217; as he had my horse an&#8217;
saddle in his camp an&#8217; didn&#8217;t want Harshaw in his wool.
So he cussed us out an&#8217; let it go at that. Different now.
I&#8217;m playin&#8217; a lone hand&mdash;haven&#8217;t got the boss back
of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;F-fellow drifted in from Vernal yesterday,&#8221; the
justice piped, easing himself in his chair. &#8220;Told a s-story
might interest you. Said Jake Houck had some trouble
with a y-young Ute buck over a hawss. Houck had been
drinkin&#8217;, I reckon. Anyhow he let the Injun have it in
the stomach. Two-three shots outa his six-gun. The
Utes claimed it was murder. Jake he didn&#8217;t wait to
adjust no claims, but lit out on the jump.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t the Government get him?&#8221;</p>
<p>The fat man shrugged. &#8220;Oh, well, a Ute&#8217;s a Ute.
Point is that Houck, who always was a t-tough nut, has
gone bad since the boys rode him on a rail. He&#8217;s proud
as Lucifer, an&#8217; it got under his hide. He&#8217;s kinda cuttin&#8217;
loose an&#8217; givin&#8217; the devil in him free rein. Wouldn&#8217;t
surprise me if he turned into a killer of the worst kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s eyes fastened to his uneasily. &#8220;You think
he&#8217;s&mdash;after me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;ll d-do to watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>Blister rolled a cigarette and lit it before he asked
casually, &#8220;Stayin&#8217; long in town?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leavin&#8217; to-day for the ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What size gun you carry for rattlesnakes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine&#8217;s a forty-five.&#8221; Bob took it out, examined it,
and thrust the weapon between his trousers and his
shirt. If he felt any mental disturbance he did not show
it except in the anxious eyes.</p>
<p>Blister changed the subject lightly. &#8220;Hear anything
ab-b-bout the Utes risin&#8217;? Any talk of it down the
river?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some. The same old stuff. I&#8217;ve been hearin&#8217; it for a
year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About ripe, looks like. This business of Houck ain&#8217;t
gonna help any. There&#8217;s a big bunch of &#8217;em over there
in the hills now. They&#8217;ve been runnin&#8217; off stock from
outlying ranches.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! The Indians are tamed. They&#8217;ll never go on
the warpath again, Blister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;J-just once more, an&#8217; right soon now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The justice gave his reasons for thinking so, while
Bob listened rather inattentively. The boy wanted to
ask him about June, but he remembered what his fat
friend had told him last time he mentioned her to him.
He was still extremely sensitive about his failure to
protect his girl-wife and he did not want to lay himself
open to snubs.</p>
<p>Bob sauntered from the office, and before he had
walked a dozen steps came face to face with June. She
was coming out of a grocery with some packages in her
arms. The color flooded her dusky cheeks. She looked
at him, startled, like a fawn poised for flight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>During the half-year since he had seen her June had
been transformed. She had learned the value of clothes.
No longer did she wear a shapeless sack for a dress. Her
shoes were small and shapely, her black hair neatly
brushed and coiffed. The months had softened and
developed the lines of the girlish figure. Kindness and
friendliness had vitalized the expression of the face and
banished its sullenness. The dark eyes, with just a hint
of wistful appeal, were very lovely.</p>
<p>Both of them were taken unawares. Neither knew
what to do or say. After the first instant of awkwardness
June moved forward and passed him silently.</p>
<p>Bob went down the street, seeing nothing. His pulses
trembled with excitement. This charming girl was his
wife, or at least she once had been for an hour. She had
sworn to love, honor, and obey him. There had been a
moment in the twilight when they had come together to
the verge of something divinely sweet and wonderful,
when they had gazed into each other&#8217;s eyes and had
looked across the boundary of the promised land.</p>
<p>If he had only kept the faith with her! If he had
stood by her in the hour of her great need! The bitterness
of his failure ate into the soul of the range-rider as it
had done already a thousand times. It did not matter
what he did. He could never atone for the desertion on
their wedding day. The horrible fact was written in
blood. It could not be erased. Forever it would have to
stand between them. An unbridgeable gulf separated
them, created by his shameless weakness.</p>
<p>When Bob came to earth he found himself clumping
down the river road miles from town. He turned and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
walked back to Bear Cat. His cowpony was at the corral
and he was due at the ranch by night.</p>
<p>Young Dillon&#8217;s thoughts had been so full of June and
his relation to her that it was with a shock of surprise he
saw Jake Houck swing out from the hotel porch and
bar the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s where you &#8217;n&#8217; me have a settlement,&#8221; the
Brown&#8217;s Park man announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not lookin&#8217; for trouble,&#8221; Bob said, and again he
was aware of a heavy sinking at the stomach.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never are,&#8221; jeered Houck. &#8220;But it&#8217;s right here
waitin&#8217; for you, Mr. Rabbit Heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob heard the voices of children coming down the
road on their way from school. He knew that two or
three loungers were watching him and Houck from the
doors of adjacent buildings. He was aware of a shouting
and commotion farther up the street. But these details
reached him only through some subconscious sense
of absorption. His whole attention was concentrated on
the man in front of him who was lashing himself into a
fighting rage.</p>
<p>What did Houck mean to do? Would he throw down
on him and kill? Or would he attack with his bare
hands? Fury and hatred boiled into the big man&#8217;s face.
His day had come. He would have his revenge no matter
what it cost. Bob could guess what hours of seething
rage had filled Houck&#8217;s world. The freckle-faced
camp flunkey had interfered with his plans, snatched
from him the bride he had chosen, brought upon him a
humiliation that must be gall to his proud spirit whenever
he thought of Bear Cat&#8217;s primitive justice. He
would pay his debt in full.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>The disturbance up the street localized itself. A
woman picked up her skirts and flew wildly into a store.
A man went over the park fence almost as though he had
been shot out of a catapult. Came the crack of a revolver.
Some one shouted explanation. &#8220;Mad dog!&#8221;</p>
<p>A brindle bull terrier swung round the corner and
plunged forward. With bristling hair and foaming
mouth, it was a creature of horrible menace.</p>
<p>Houck leaped for the door of the hotel. Bob was at
his heels, in a panic to reach safety.</p>
<p>A child&#8217;s scream rang out. Dillon turned. The school
children were in wild flight, but one fair-haired little
girl stood as though paralyzed in the middle of the road.
She could not move out of the path of the wild beast
bearing down upon her.</p>
<p>Instinctively Bob&#8217;s mind functioned. The day was
warm and his coat hung over an arm. He stepped into
the road as the brindle bull came opposite the hotel.
The coat was swung out expertly and dropped over the
animal&#8217;s head. The cowpuncher slipped to his knees,
arms tightening and fingers feeling for the throat of the
writhing brute struggling blindly.</p>
<p>Its snapping jaws just missed his hand. Man and
dog rolled over into the dust together. Its hot breath
fanned Bob&#8217;s face. Again he was astride of the dog. His
fingers had found its throat at last. They tightened, in
spite of its horrible muscular contortions to get free.</p>
<p>There came a swish of skirts, the soft pad of running
feet. A girl&#8217;s voice asked, &#8220;What shall I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>It did not at that moment seem strange to Dillon that
June was beside him, her face quick with tremulous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
anxiety. He spoke curtly, as one who gives orders,
panting under the strain of the effort to hold the dog.</p>
<p>&#8220;My gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>She picked the forty-five up from where it had fallen.
Their eyes met. The girl did swiftly what had to be
done. It was not until she was alone in her room half an
hour later that the thought of it made her sick.</p>
<p>Bob rose, breathing deep. For an instant their eyes
held fast. She handed him the smoking revolver. Neither
of them spoke.</p>
<p>From every door, so it seemed, people poured and
converged toward them. Excited voices took up the
tale, disputed, explained, offered excuses. Everybody
talked except June and Bob.</p>
<p>Blister rolled into the picture. &#8220;Dawg-gone my hide
if I ever see anything to b-beat that. He was q-quick as
c-chain lightnin&#8217;, the boy was. Johnny on the spot.
Jumped the critter s-slick as a whistle.&#8221; His fat hand
slapped Bob&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;The boy was sure there with
both hands and feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about June?&#8221; demanded Mollie. &#8220;Seems to
me she wasn&#8217;t more&#8217;n a mile away while you men-folks
were skedaddlin&#8217; for cover.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fat man&#8217;s body shook with laughter. &#8220;The boys
didn&#8217;t s-stop to make any farewell speeches, tha&#8217;s a
fact. I traveled some my own self, but I hadn&#8217;t hardly
got started before Houck was outa sight, an&#8217; him
claimin&#8217; he was lookin&#8217; for trouble too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that kind of trouble,&#8221; grinned Mike the bartender.
He could afford to laugh, for since he had been
busy inside he had not been one of the vanishing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
heroes. &#8220;Don&#8217;t blame him a mite either. If it comes
to that I&#8217;m givin&#8217; the right of way to a mad dog every
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmp!&#8221; snorted Mollie. &#8220;What would &#8217;a&#8217; happened
to little Maggie Wiggins if Dillon here had felt that
way?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob touched Blister on the arm and whispered in his
ear. &#8220;Get me to the doc. I gotta have a bite cauterized.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was hardly more than a scratch, but while the
doctor was making his preparations the puncher went
pale as service-berry blossoms. He sat down, grown suddenly
faint. The bite of a mad dog held sinister possibilities.</p>
<p>Blister fussed around cheerfully until the doctor had
finished. &#8220;Every silver l-lining has got its cloud, don&#8217;t
you r-reckon? Here&#8217;s Jake Houck now, all s-set for a
massacree. He&#8217;s a wolf, an&#8217; it&#8217;s his night to howl. Don&#8217;t
care who knows it, by gum. Hands still red from one
killin&#8217;. A rip-snortin&#8217; he-wolf from the bad lands!
Along comes Mr. Mad Dog, an&#8217; Jake he hunts his hole
with his tail hangin&#8217;. Kinda takes the tuck outa him.
Bear Cat wouldn&#8217;t hardly stand for him gunnin&#8217; you
now, Bob. Not after you tacklin&#8217; that crazy bull terrier
to save the kids. He&#8217;ll have to postpone that settlement
he was promisin&#8217; you so big.&#8221;</p>
<p>The puncher voiced the fear in his mind. &#8220;Do folks
always go mad when they&#8217;re bit by a mad dog, doctor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a chance hardly,&#8221; Dr. Tuckerman reassured.
&#8220;First place, the dog probably wasn&#8217;t mad. Second
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
place, &#8217;t wa&#8217;n&#8217;t but a scratch and we got at it right away.
No, sir. You don&#8217;t need to worry a-tall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside the doctor&#8217;s office Blister and Bob met Houck.
The Brown&#8217;s Park man scowled at the puncher. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not through with you. Don&#8217;t you think it! Jus&#8217; because
you had a lucky fluke escape&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tacklin&#8217; a crazy wild beast whilst you an&#8217; me were
holin&#8217; up,&#8221; Blister interjected.</p>
<p>Houck looked at the fat man bleakly. &#8220;You in this,
Mr. Meddler? If you&#8217;re not declarin&#8217; yoreself in, I&#8217;d
advise you to keep out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blister Haines laughed amiably with intent to conciliate.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of nursin&#8217; a grudge against the
boy, Houck? He never did you any harm. S-shake
hands an&#8217; call it off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You manage yore business if you&#8217;ve got any. I&#8217;ll
run mine,&#8221; retorted Houck. To Bob he said meaningly
as he turned away, &#8220;One o&#8217; these days, young fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The threat chilled Dillon, but it was impossible just
now to remain depressed. He rode back to the ranch in
a glow of pleasure. Thoughts of June filled every crevice
of his mind. They had shared an adventure together,
had been partners in a moment of peril. She
could not wholly despise him now. He was willing to admit
that Houck had been right when he called it a fluke.
The chance might not have come to him, or he might
not have taken it. The scream of little Maggie Wiggins
had saved the day for him. If he had had time to think&mdash;but
fortunately impulse had swept him into action
before he could let discretion stop him.</p>
<p>He lived over again joyfully that happy moment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
when June had stood before him pulsing with life, eager,
fear-filled, tremulous. He had taken the upper hand and
she had accepted his leadership. The thing his eyes had
told her to do she had done. He would remember that&mdash;he
would remember it always.</p>
<p>Nor did it dim his joy that he felt himself to be a
fraud. It had taken no pluck to do what he did, since he
had only obeyed a swift dominating mental reaction to
the situation. The real courage had been hers.</p>
<p>He knew now that he would have to take her with
him in his thoughts on many a long ride whether he
wanted to or not.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>JUNE IS GLAD</h3>
</div>

<p>June turned away from the crowd surrounding the
dead mad dog and walked into the hotel. The eyes of
more than one man followed the slim, graceful figure
admiringly. Much water had run down the Rio Blanco
since the days when she had been the Cinderella of
Piceance Creek. The dress she wore was simple, but
through it a vivid personality found expression. No
longer was she a fiery little rebel struggling passionately
against a sense of inferiority. She had come down from
the hills to a country filled with laughter and the ripple
of brooks.</p>
<p>The desire to be alone was strong upon her&mdash;alone
with the happy thoughts that pushed themselves turbulently
through her mind. She was tremulous with excitement.
For she hoped that she had found a dear
friend who had been lost.</p>
<p>Once, on that dreadful day she would never forget,
June had told Jake Houck that Bob Dillon was as brave
as he. It had been the forlorn cry of a heart close to despair.
But the words were true. She hugged that knowledge
to her bosom. Jake had run away while Bob had
stayed to face the mad dog. And not Jake alone! Blister
Haines had run, with others of tested courage. Bob
had outgamed him. He admitted it cheerfully.</p>
<p>Maybe the others had not seen little Maggie Wiggins.
But Bob had seen her. The child&#8217;s cry had carried him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
back into the path of the brindle terrier. June was
proud, not only of what he had done, but of the way he
had done it. His brain had functioned swiftly, his motions
been timed exactly. Only coördination of all his
muscles had enabled him to down the dog so expertly
and render the animal harmless.</p>
<p>During the months since she had seen him June had
thought often of the man whose name she legally bore.
After the first few hours there had been no harshness in
her memories of him. He was good. She had always
felt that. There was something fine and sweet and generous
in his nature. Without being able to reason it out,
she was sure that no fair judgment would condemn him
wholly because at a crisis he had failed to exhibit a quality
the West holds in high esteem and considers fundamental.
Into her heart there had come a tender pity for
him, a maternal sympathy that flowed out whenever he
came into her musings.</p>
<p>Poor boy! She had learned to know him so well. He
would whip himself with his own scorn. This misadventure
that had overwhelmed him might frustrate all
the promise of his life. He was too sensitive. If he lost
heart&mdash;if he gave up&mdash;</p>
<p>She had longed to send a message of hope to him, but
she had been afraid that he might misunderstand it.
Her position was ambiguous. She was his wife. The law
said so. But of course she was not his wife at all except
in name. They were joint victims of evil circumstance,
a boy and a girl who had rushed to a foolish extreme.
Some day one or the other of them would ask the law
to free them of the tie that technically bound them
together.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>Now she need not worry about him any longer. He
had proved his mettle publicly. The court of common
opinion would reverse the verdict it had passed upon
him. He would go out of her life and she need no longer
feel responsible for the shadow that had fallen over
his.</p>
<p>So she reasoned consistently, but something warm
within her gave the lie to this cold disposition of their
friendship. She did not want to let him go his way. She
had no intention of letting him go. She could not express
it, but in some intangible way he belonged to her.
As a brother might, she told herself; not because Blister
Haines had married them when they had gone to him in
their hurry to solve a difficulty. Not for that reason at
all, but because from the first hour of meeting, their
spirits had gone out to each other in companionship.
Bob had understood her. He had been the only person
to whom she could confide her troubles, the only pal she
had ever known.</p>
<p>Standing before the glass in her small bedroom, June
saw that her eyes were shining, the blood glowing
through the dusky cheeks. Joy had vitalized her whole
being, had made her beautiful as a wild rose. For the
moment at least she was lyrically happy.</p>
<p>This ardor still possessed June when she went into the
dining-room to make the set-ups for supper. She sang
snatches of &#8220;Dixie&#8221; and &#8220;My Old Kentucky Home&#8221; as
she moved about her work. She hummed the chorus of
&#8220;Juanita.&#8221; From that she drifted to the old spiritual
&#8220;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.&#8221;</p>
<p>A man was washing his hands in the tin basin provided
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
outside for guests of the hotel. Through the window
came to him the lilt of the fresh young voice.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style=' margin-left:4em;'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Swing low, sweet chariot,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Comin&#8217; fo&#8217; to carry me home.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The look of sullen, baffled rage on the man&#8217;s dark face
did not lighten. He had been beaten again. His revenge
had been snatched from him almost at the moment of
triumph. If that mad dog had not come round the corner
just when it did, he would have evened the score between
him and Dillon. June had seen the whole thing.
She had been a partner in the red-headed boy&#8217;s ovation.
Houck ground his teeth in futile anger.</p>
<p>Presently he slouched into the dining-room.</p>
<p>Mollie saw him and walked across the room to June.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait on him if you don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>The waitress shook her head. &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want him
to think I&#8217;m afraid of him. I&#8217;m not, either. I&#8217;ll wait on
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>June took Houck&#8217;s order and presently served it.</p>
<p>His opaque eyes watched her in the way she remembered
of old. They were still bold and possessive, still
curtained windows through which she glimpsed volcanic
passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can tell that squirt Dillon I ain&#8217;t through with
him yet, not by a jugful,&#8221; he growled.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have anything to tell Bob Dillon, say it to
<i>him</i>,&#8221; June answered, looking at him with fearless, level
eyes of scorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I ain&#8217;t through with you, I&#8217;d have you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>June finished putting his order on the table. &#8220;But
I&#8217;m through with you, Jake Houck,&#8221; she said, very
quietly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think it. Don&#8217;t you think it for a minute,&#8221;
he snarled. &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped, sputtering with fury. June had turned
and walked into the kitchen. He rose, evidently intending
to follow her.</p>
<p>Mollie Larson barred the way, a grim, square figure
with the air of a brigadier-general.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, Jake Houck,&#8221; she ordered. &#8220;Or get out.
I don&#8217;t care which. But don&#8217;t you think I&#8217;ll set by an&#8217;
let you pester that girl. If you had a lick o&#8217; sense you&#8217;d
know it ain&#8217;t safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was nothing soft about Houck. He was a hard
and callous citizen, and he lived largely outside the law
and other people&#8217;s standards of conduct. But he knew
when he had run up against a brick wall. Mrs. Larson
had only to lift her voice and half a dozen men would
come running. He was in the country of the enemy, so
to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I pesterin&#8217; her?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Can&#8217;t I talk to
a girl I knew when she was a baby? Have I got to get an
O.K. from you before I say &#8216;Good-mawnin&#8217; to her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her father left June in my charge. I&#8217;m intendin&#8217; to
see you let her alone. Get that straight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Houck gave up with a shrug of his big shoulders. He
sat down and attacked the steak on his plate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>&#8220;INJUNS&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Bob swung down from the saddle in front of the bunkhouse.</p>
<p>Reeves came to the door and waved a hand. &#8220;&#8217;Lo,
Sure-Shot! What&#8217;s new in Bear Cat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fellow thinkin&#8217; of startin&#8217; a drug-store. Jim Weaver
is the happy dad of twins. Mad dog shot on Main
Street. New stage-line for Marvine planned. Mr. Jake
Houck is enjoyin&#8217; a pleasant visit to our little city. I
reckon that&#8217;s about all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dud had joined Tom in the doorway. &#8220;Meet up with
Mr. Houck?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have any talk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He had some, but he hadn&#8217;t hardly got to goin&#8217; good
when the mad dog sashayed up the street. Mr. Houck
he adjourned the meetin&#8217; immediate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More important business, I reckon,&#8221; Dud grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t mention it, but all those present were in a
kinda hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So&#8217;s some one else.&#8221; Reeves nodded his head toward
a small cloud of dust approaching the ranch.</p>
<p>A rider galloped up and dragged his mount to a halt.
&#8220;Utes have broke out! Killed a trapper on Squaw
Creek! Burned two nesters&#8217; houses!&#8221; His voice was
high and excited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rumor?&#8221; asked Dud.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. I talked with a fellow that seen the body.
Met two families that had lit out from Squaw Creek.
They&#8217;re sure enough on the warpath.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harshaw took the matter seriously. He gave crisp
orders to his riders to cover the creeks and warn all
settlers to leave for Bear Cat or Meeker. Dud and Bob
were assigned Milk Creek.</p>
<p>It was hard for the young fellows, as they rode through
a land of warm sunshine, to believe that there actually
was another Indian outbreak. It had been ten years
since the Meeker massacre and the defeat of Major
Thornburg&#8217;s troops. The country had begun to settle
up. The Utes knew that their day was done, though
they still came up occasionally from the reservation
on illicit hunting trips.</p>
<p>This very country over which they were riding was
the scene of the Thornburg battle-field. The Indians
had lain in ambush and waited for the troops to come
over the brow of the rise. At the first volley the commander
of the soldiers had fallen mortally wounded.
The whites, taken by surprise, fell back in disorder.
The Utes moved up on them from both sides and the
trapped men fled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must &#8217;a&#8217; been right about here Thornburg was shot,&#8221;
explained Dud. &#8220;Charley Mason was one o&#8217; the soldiers
an&#8217; he told me all about it. Captain Jack was in charge
of this bunch of Utes. Seems he had signal fires arranged
with those at the agency an&#8217; they began their
attacks at the same time. Charley claimed they didn&#8217;t
know there was Injuns within twenty miles when the
bullets began to sing. Says he ran five miles before he
took a breath.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>Bob looked around apprehensively. History might
repeat itself. At this very moment the Utes might be
lying in the draw ready to fire on them. He was filled
with a sudden urgent desire to get through with their
job and turn the heads of their ponies toward Bear Cat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Makes a fellow feel kinda squeamish,&#8221; Dud said.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s move, Bob.&#8221;</p>
<p>They carried the word to the settlers on the creek and
turned in the direction of Bear Cat. They reached town
late and found the place bustling with excitement.
Families of settlers were arriving in wagons and on
horseback from all directions. There were rumors that
the Indians were marching on the town. A company of
militia had been ordered to the scene by the Governor
of the State and was expected to arrive on the second
day from this.</p>
<p>Camp-fires were burning in the park plaza and round
them were grouped men, women, and children in from
the ranches. On all the roads leading to town sentries
were stationed. Others walked a patrol along the riverbank
and along the skirts of the foothills.</p>
<p>Three or four cowpunchers had been celebrating the
declaration of war. In the community was a general
feeling that the Utes must be put down once for all. In
spite of the alarm many were glad that the unrest had
come to an issue at last.</p>
<p>Bob and Dud tied their horses to a hitching-rack and
climbed the fence into the park. Blister came out of the
shadows to meet them.</p>
<p>&#8220;W-whad I tell you, Texas man?&#8221; he asked of Bob.
&#8220;Show-down at last, like I said.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>Into the night lifted a startled yell. &#8220;Here come the
Injuns!&#8221;</p>
<p>Taut nerves snapped. Wails of terror rose here and
there. A woman fainted. The sound of a revolver shot
rang out.</p>
<p>One of the roisterers, who had been loud in his threats
of what he meant to do to the Indians, lost his braggadocio
instantly. He leaped for the saddle of the nearest
horse and dug his spurs home. In his fuddled condition
he made a mistake. He had chosen, as a mount upon
which to escape, the fence that encircled the park.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gid ap! Gid ap!&#8221; he screamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yore bronc is some balky, ain&#8217;t it, Jud?&#8221; Hollister
asked. He had already discovered that the panic had
been caused by a false cry of &#8220;Wolf&#8221; raised by one of
the fence rider&#8217;s companions.</p>
<p>&#8220;S-some one hitched it to a post,&#8221; Blister suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ride him, puncher,&#8221; urged Bob. &#8220;Stick to yore
saddle if he does buck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jud came off the fence sheepishly. &#8220;I was aimin&#8217; to
go get help,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where was you going for it&mdash;to Denver?&#8221; asked
Blister.</p>
<p>The night wore itself out. With the coming of day the
spirits of the less hardy revived. The ranchers on the
plaza breakfasted in groups, after which their children
were bundled off to school. Scouts rode out to learn the
whereabouts of the Utes and others to establish contact
with the approaching militia.</p>
<p>Harshaw organized a company of rangers made up
mostly of cowpunchers from the river ranches. During
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
the day more of these drifted in. By dusk he had a
group of forty hard-riding young fellows who could
shoot straight and were acquainted with the country
over which they would have to operate. Blister was
second in command. All of the Slash Lazy D riders had
enlisted except one who had recently broken a leg.</p>
<p>Scouts brought in word that the Utes had swung
round Bear Cat and were camped about thirty miles up
the river. Harshaw moved out to meet them. He suspected
the Indians of planning to ambush the militia
before the soldiers could join forces with the rangers.</p>
<p>Bob had joined the rangers with no enthusiasm. He
had enlisted because of pressure both within and without.
He would have been ashamed not to offer himself.
Moreover, everybody seemed to assume he would
go. But he would much rather have stayed at Bear Cat
with the home guards. From what he had picked up, he
was far from sure that the Utes were to blame this time.
The Houck killing, for instance. And that was not the
only outrage they had endured. It struck him more like
a rising of the whites. They had provoked the young
bucks a good deal, and a sheriff&#8217;s posse had arrested
some of them for being off the reservation hunting.
Wise diplomacy might at least have deferred the conflict.</p>
<p>During the bustle of preparing to leave, Bob&#8217;s spirits
were normal even though his nerves were a little fluttery.
As they rode out of town he caught sight for a moment
of a slim, dark girl in a blue gingham at the door
of the hotel. She waved a hand toward the group of
horsemen. It was Dud who answered the good-bye. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
had already, Bob guessed, said a private farewell of his
own to June. At any rate, his friend had met Hollister
coming out of the hotel a few minutes before. The cowpuncher&#8217;s
eyes were shining and a blue skirt was vanishing
down the passage. There had been a queer ache in
Bob Dillon&#8217;s heart. He did not blame either of them.
Of course June would prefer Dud to him. Any girl in her
senses would. He had all the charm of gay and gallant
youth walking in the sunshine.</p>
<p>None the less it hurt and depressed him that there
should be a private understanding between his friend
and June. A poignant jealousy stabbed him. There was
nothing in his character to attract a girl like June of
swift and pouncing passion. He was too tame, too fearful.
Dud had a spice of the devil in him. It flamed out
unexpectedly. Yet he was reliable too. This clean,
brown man, fair-haired and steady-eyed, riding with
such incomparable ease, would do to tie to, in the
phrase of the country. Small wonder a girl&#8217;s heart
turned to him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>A RECRUIT JOINS THE RANGERS</h3>
</div>

<p>Harshaw did not, during the first forty-eight hours
after leaving Bear Cat, make contact with either the
Indians or the militia. He moved warily, throwing out
scouts as his party advanced. At night he posted sentries
carefully to guard against a surprise attack. It was
not the habit of the tribes to assault in the darkness, but
he was taking no chances. It would be easy to fall into
an ambush, but he had no intention of letting the
rangers become the victims of carelessness.</p>
<p>At the mouth of Wolf Creek a recruit joined the company.
He rode up after camp had been made for the
night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jake Houck,&#8221; Bob whispered to Dud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s boss of this outfit?&#8221; the big man demanded
of Blister after he had swung from the saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harshaw. You&#8217;ll find him over there with the
cavvy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Houck straddled across to the remuda.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lookin&#8217; for men to fight the Utes?&#8221; he asked
brusquely of the owner of the Slash Lazy D brand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you mean business an&#8217; ain&#8217;t bully-pussin&#8217; I&#8217;ll take
a hand,&#8221; the Brown&#8217;s Park man said, and both voice
and manner were offensive.</p>
<p>The captain of the rangers met him eye to eye. He did
not like this fellow. His reputation was bad. In the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
days he had been a rustler, rumor said. Since the affair
of the Tolliver girl he had been very sulky and morose.
This had culminated in the killing of the Ute. What the
facts were about this Harshaw did not know. The man
might be enlisting to satisfy a grudge or to make himself
safe against counter-attack by helping to drive the Indians
back to the reservation. The point that stood out
was that Houck was a first-class fighting man. That was
enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;We mean business, Houck. Glad to have you join
us. But get this straight. I&#8217;ll not have you startin&#8217;
trouble in camp. If you&#8217;ve got a private quarrel against
any of the boys it will have to wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t aimin&#8217; to start anything,&#8221; growled Houck.
&#8220;Not till this job&#8217;s finished.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good enough. Hear or see anything of the Utes as
you came?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which way you come?&#8221;</p>
<p>Houck told him. Presently the two men walked back
toward the chuck-wagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meet Mr. Houck, boys, any of you that ain&#8217;t already
met him,&#8221; said Harshaw by way of introduction. &#8220;He&#8217;s
going to trail along with us for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>The situation was awkward. Several of those present
had met Houck only as the victim of their rude justice
the night that June Tolliver had swum the river to escape
him. Fortunately the cook at that moment bawled
out that supper was ready.</p>
<p>Afterward Blister had a word with Bob and Dud while
he was arranging sentry duty with them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wish that b-bird hadn&#8217;t come. He&#8217;s here because
he wants to drive the Utes outa the country before they
get him. The way I heard it he had no business to kill
that b-buck. Throwed down on him an&#8217; killed him onexpected.
I didn&#8217;t c-come to pull Jake Houck&#8217;s chestnuts
outa the fire for him. Not none. He ain&#8217;t lookin&#8217;
for to round up the Injuns and herd &#8217;em back to the reservation.
He&#8217;s allowin&#8217; to kill as many as he can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did anybody see him shoot the Ute?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems not. They was back of a stable. When folks
got there the Ute was down, but still alive. He claimed
he never made a move to draw. Houck&#8217;s story was that
he shot in self-defense. Looked fishy. The Injun&#8217;s gun
wasn&#8217;t in s-sight anywheres.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Houck&#8217;s a bad actor,&#8221; Dud said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Blister came back to the order of the day.
&#8220;All right, boys. Shifts of three hours each, then.
T-turn an&#8217; turn about. You two take this knoll here. If
you see anything movin&#8217; that looks suspicious, blaze
away. We&#8217;ll c-come a-runnin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob had drunk at supper two cups of strong coffee instead
of his usual one. His thought had been that the
stimulant would tend to keep him awake on duty. The
effect the coffee had on him was to make his nerves
jumpy. He lay on the knoll, rifle clutched fast in his
hands, acutely sensitive to every sound, to every hazy
shadow of the night. The very silence was sinister. His
imagination peopled the sage with Utes, creeping toward
him with a horrible and deadly patience. Chills
tattooed up and down his spine.</p>
<p>He pulled out the old silver watch he carried and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
looked at the time. It lacked five minutes of ten o&#8217;clock.
The watch must have stopped. He held it to his ear and
was surprised at the ticking. Was it possible that he had
been on sentry duty only twelve minutes? To his highly
strung nerves it had seemed like hours.</p>
<p>A twig snapped. His muscles jumped. He waited,
gun ready for action, eyes straining into the gloom.
Something rustled and sped away swiftly. It must have
been a rabbit or perhaps a skunk. But for a moment his
heart had been in his throat.</p>
<p>Again he consulted the watch. Five minutes past ten!
Impossible, yet true. In that eternity of time only a few
minutes had slipped away.</p>
<p>He resolved not to look at his watch again till after
eleven. Meanwhile he invented games to divert his
mind from the numbing fear that filled him. He counted
the definite objects that stood out of the darkness&mdash;the
clumps of sage, the greasewood bushes, the cottonwood
trees by the river. It was his duty to patrol the
distance between the knoll and those trees at intervals.
Each time he crept to the river with a thumping heart.
Those bushes&mdash;were they really willows or Indians
waiting to slay him when he got closer?</p>
<p>Fear is paralyzing. It pushes into the background all
the moral obligations. Half a dozen times the young
ranger was on the point of waking Dud to tell him that
he could not stand it alone. He recalled Blister&#8217;s injunctions.
But what was the use of throwing back his
head and telling himself he was made in the image of
God when his fluttering pulses screamed denial, when
his heart pumped water instead of blood?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>He stuck it out. How he never knew. But somehow
he clamped his teeth and went through. As he grew
used to it, his imagination became less active and
tricky. There were moments, toward the end of his
vigil, when he could smile grimly at the terror that had
obsessed him. He was a born coward, but he did not
need to let anybody know it. It would always be within
his power to act game whether he was or not.</p>
<p>At one o&#8217;clock he woke Dud. That young man rolled
out of his blanket grumbling amiably. &#8220;Fine business!
Why don&#8217;t a fellow ever know when he&#8217;s well off? Me, I
might be hittin&#8217; the hay at Bear Cat or Meeker instead
of rollin&#8217; out to watch for Utes that ain&#8217;t within thirty or
forty miles of here likely. Fellow, next war I stay at
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob slipped into his friend&#8217;s warm blanket. He had
no expectation of sleeping, but inside of five minutes his
eyes had closed and he was off.</p>
<p>The sound of voices wakened him. Dud was talking
to the jingler who had just come off duty. The sunlight
was pouring upon him. He jumped up in consternation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I musta overslept,&#8221; Bob said.</p>
<p>Dud grinned. &#8220;Some. Fact is, I hadn&#8217;t the heart to
waken you when you was poundin&#8217; yore ear so peaceful
an&#8217; tuneful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You stood my turn, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well. It was only three hours. That&#8217;s no way to
divide the night anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were eating breakfast when a messenger rode
into camp. He was from Major Sheahan of the militia.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
That officer sent word that the Indians were in Box
Cañon. He had closed one end and suggested that the
rangers move into the other and bottle the Utes.</p>
<p>Harshaw broke camp at once and started for the
cañon. A storm blew up, a fierce and pelting hail. The
company took refuge in a cottonwood grove. The stones
were as large as good-sized plums, and in three minutes
the ground was covered. Under the stinging ice bullets
the horses grew very restless. More than one went
plunging out into the open and had to be forced back to
shelter by the rider. Fortunately the storm passed as
quickly as it had come up. The sun broke through the
clouds and shone warmly upon rivulets of melted ice
pouring down to the Blanco.</p>
<p>Scouts were thrown forward once more and the rangers
swung into the hills toward Box Cañon.</p>
<p>&#8220;How far?&#8221; Bob asked Tom Reeves.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout half an hour now, I reckon. Hope we get there
before the Injuns have lit out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Privately Bob hoped they would not. He had never
been under fire and his throat dried at the anticipation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;We&#8217;re humpin&#8217; along right
lively. Be there in time, I expect. Too bad if we have to
chase &#8217;em again all over the map.&#8221;</p>
<p>Box Cañon is a sword slash cut through the hills.
From wall to wall it is scarcely forty feet across. One
looks up to a slit of blue sky above.</p>
<p>Harshaw halted close to the entrance. &#8220;Let&#8217;s make
sure where Mr. Ute is before we ride in, boys. He might
be up on the bluffs layin&#8217; for us. Dud, you an&#8217; Tom an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
Big Bill go take a look-see an&#8217; make sure. We&#8217;ll come
a-runnin&#8217; if we hear yore guns pop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two men in uniform rode out of the gulch. At the
sight of the rangers they cantered forward. One was a
sergeant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too late,&#8221; said he. &#8220;They done slipped away from
us. We took shelter from the hail under a cutbank where
the cañon widens. They musta slipped by us then. We
found their tracks in the wet ground. They&#8217;re headin&#8217;
west again, looks like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a warm trail,&#8221; Harshaw said to Blister
Haines. &#8220;We better go right after &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hot foot,&#8221; agreed Blister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Major Sheahan&#8217;s followin&#8217; them now. He said for
you to come right along.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cavalcade moved at once.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>&#8220;DON&#8217;T YOU LIKE ME ANY MORE?&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Harshaw&#8217;s rangers caught up with the militia an hour
later. The valley men were big, tanned, outdoor fellows,
whereas the militia company was composed of young
lads from Colorado towns, most of them slight and not
yet fully developed. The state troopers were, however,
brisk, alert, and soldierly. Some of them were not used
to riding, but they made the best of it with the cheerful
adaptability of American youth.</p>
<p>The trail of the Indians cut back across the mesa toward
Utah. Evidently they were making for their home
country again. Bob began to hope that the Utes would
reach the reservation without a fight. In this desire the
owner of the Slash Lazy D heartily joined. He had no
impulses toward the slaughter of the tribal remnants.</p>
<p>Others of the party did not share this feeling. Without
going into the causes of the Indian troubles, it can
safely be said that the frontiersmen generally believed
that the tribes were dangerous and not to be trusted.
In any difficulty between a white and a red man they assumed
the latter was to blame. Many old-timers held
that the only way to settle the Indian question was to
exterminate the tribes or at least reduce them to impotence.</p>
<p>The pursuers followed a hot trail. Twice they had a
brush with the rear guard of the flying Utes, during
which Bob heard bullets singing above his head. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
felt a very unpleasant sinking in the pit of his stomach,
and could hardly resist the temptation to slip out of the
saddle and take refuge behind the horse he was riding.</p>
<p>The rangers and the soldiers reached Bear Cat long
after dark. Dud and Reeves had ridden into town ahead
of their companions, so that when the rest came in they
found a hot supper waiting for them on the plaza.</p>
<p>June helped serve the weary men. Big fires had been
built on the square and by the light of the flames Bob
could see her slim figure flitting to and fro. Afterward,
when the meal was at an end, he saw Dud Hollister
walking beside her to the hotel. The cowpuncher was
carrying a load of dishes and supplies. It would have
surprised Bob to learn that he was the subject of their
conversation.</p>
<p>For the first time Dud had heard that day from Blister
the story of the mad dog episode. He made June tell it
to him again from her viewpoint. When she had finished
he asked her a question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody ever tell you about the fight Bob had with
Bandy Walker?&#8221;</p>
<p>The light in her dark eyes quickened. &#8220;Did they have
a fight?&#8221; she asked evenly, with not too great a show of
interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno as you could rightly call it a fight,&#8221; Dud
drawled. &#8220;Bob he hammered Bandy, tromped on him,
chewed him up, an&#8217; spit him out. He was plumb active
for about five minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was the trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bandy&#8217;s one o&#8217; these mean bullies. He figured he
could run on Bob. The boy took it meek an&#8217; humble for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
a week or so before he settled with Bandy generous an&#8217;
handsome. The bow-legged guy might have got away
with it if he hadn&#8217;t made a mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A mistake?&#8221; repeated June.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had a few remarks to make about a young lady
Bob knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>June said nothing. In the darkness Dud made out
only the dusky outline of her profile. He could not tell
what she was thinking, had no guess that her blood
was racing tumultuously, that a lump was swelling in
the soft round throat.</p>
<p>Presently she asked her companion a question as to
how Jake Houck came to be with the rangers. Dud
understood that the subject was changed.</p>
<p>The soldiers found beds wherever they could. Some
rolled up in their blankets near the fires. Others burrowed
into haystacks on the meadow. Before daybreak
they expected to be on the march again.</p>
<p>The bugle wakened them at dawn, but a good many
of the cowpunchers were already up. Big Bill went to
one of the haystacks to get feed for his horse. He gathered
a great armful of hay and started away with it. A
muffled voice inside wailed protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lemme out, doggone it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill dropped the hay, and from it emerged a short and
slender youth in uniform. He bristled up to the huge
puncher.</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;you think you&#8217;re doing, fellow?&#8221;</p>
<p>The cowpuncher sat down on a feed-rack and laughed
till he was weak. &#8220;Drinks are on me, son,&#8221; he gasped at
last. &#8220;I &#8217;most fed you to my hawss.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe you think because I ain&#8217;t as big as a house
you can sit there an&#8217; laugh at me. I&#8217;ll have you know
you can&#8217;t,&#8221; the boy snapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fellow, I&#8217;m not laughin&#8217; at you. Napoleon was a
runt, I&#8217;ve heard tell. But it was comical, you stickin&#8217;
yore head up through the hay thataway. I&#8217;ll stand pat
on that, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t a-going to fight about it either.&#8221;</p>
<p>The soldier&#8217;s dignity melted to a grin. &#8220;Did you say
drinks was on you, Jumbo?&#8221;</p>
<p>After Big Bill had fed his horse they went away arm
in arm to see what Dolan could do for them in the way of
liquid refreshment.</p>
<p>Just before the rangers and soldiers saddled for the
start, Dud jingled over to his friend who was helping to
pack the supply-wagons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lady wants to see you, Bob. I&#8217;ll take yore place
here,&#8221; Dud said.</p>
<p>Dillon lifted a barrel half full of flour into the nearest
wagon and straightened a body cramped from stooping.
&#8220;What lady?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to the fellow,&#8221; derided Hollister. &#8220;How
many ladies has he got on the string, do you reckon?&#8221;
The fair-haired cowpuncher grinned. &#8220;You meander
round to the back of the hotel an&#8217; I expect you&#8217;ll meet
up with the lady. Mollie Larson she&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mrs. Larson.&#8221; For a moment a wild hope had
flamed in Bob&#8217;s heart. His thoughts had flashed to another
woman in the hotel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes. Mollie runs the hotel, don&#8217;t she? Was
you lookin&#8217; for some other lady to send for you?&#8221; Dud
asked innocently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>Bob did not answer this. He was already striding toward
the hotel.</p>
<p>Out of the darkness of the adobe wall shadow a slim
figure moved to meet the ranger. The young fellow&#8217;s
heart lost a beat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;wanted to see you before you left,&#8221; a low voice
said.</p>
<p>A kind of palsy came over Dillon. He stood motionless,
no life in him except for the eloquent eyes. No
words came to help him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought&mdash;maybe&mdash;&#8221; June stopped, hesitated,
and came out impetuously with what was in her mind.
&#8220;Aren&#8217;t we <i>ever</i> going to be friends again, Bob?&#8221;</p>
<p>A warm glow suffused him. The back of his eyes
smarted with tears. He started to speak, but stopped.
For he was boyishly ashamed to discover that he could
not trust his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like me any more?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Have I
done something to make you mad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you haven&#8217;t.&#8221; There was a rough edge to the
words, put there by suppressed emotion. &#8220;You know
better &#8217;n that. I keep away from you because&mdash;because
I acted like a yellow dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you fought Bandy Walker to keep clean my
good name?&#8221; she asked in a murmur.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that!&#8221; He waved her question aside as of no
importance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or when you fought the mad dog in the street with
yore bare hands?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know when, June,&#8221; he answered bitterly.
&#8220;When I let Jake Houck walk off with you to save my
worthless hide.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve forgotten that, Bob,&#8221; she said gently. &#8220;So
much has happened since. That was foolishness anyhow,
what&mdash;what we did in Blister&#8217;s office. But I hate
to give up the boy on Piceance Creek who was kinda like
a brother to me. Do I have to lose him?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no need for her big dark eyes to plead with
him. His face was working. He bit his lip to keep from
breaking down. This was what he wanted more than
anything else in the world, but he was embarrassed and
irritated at the display of emotion he could not wholly
control.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;S all right with me,&#8221; he said gruffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll be friends again, won&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ump-ha!&#8221; he grunted. &#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;d just as lief.&#8221; He
recognized this as cavalier and added: &#8220;I mean it&#8217;s
awful good of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you come back you won&#8217;t forget to ask for me
if I&#8217;m not where you see me. I&#8217;ll want to hear all about
what you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he promised; and in a burst of gratitude
cried: &#8220;You&#8217;re a dandy girl, June. If you treated me
like I deserved you&#8217;d never speak to me again.&#8221;</p>
<p>She flushed. &#8220;That&#8217;s silly. I never did feel thataway.
Lots of times I&#8217;ve wanted to tell you that&mdash;that it
needn&#8217;t make any difference. But I couldn&#8217;t, &#8217;count of&mdash;what
we did in Blister&#8217;s office. A girl has to be awful
careful, you know. If we hadn&#8217;t done that foolish
thing&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A judge&#8217;ll fix you up with papers settin&#8217; you free,
June,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything to help that you
want.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when you come back,&#8221; she postponed. Talk
on that subject distressed and humiliated her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got to go,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave him her hand shyly. Their eyes met and fell
away.</p>
<p>He stood a moment, trying to find an effective line of
exit. He had missed his cue to leave, as thousands of
lovers have before and since.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got to hit the trail,&#8221; he murmured in anticlimax.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she agreed.</p>
<p>Bob drew back one foot and ducked his head in a bow.
A moment later he was hurrying toward the remuda.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h3>A CUP OF COLD WATER</h3>
</div>

<p>The pursuers caught up with the Utes the third day out
from Bear Cat. It was in the morning, shortly after
they had broken camp, that Houck and Big Bill while
scouting in advance of the troop jumped up an Indian
out of the sagebrush.</p>
<p>He made across the mesa toward the river. Houck
fired at him twice as he ran, but the sentinel disappeared
from sight apparently unhit. The sound of the firing
brought up rapidly the main body of the troopers. Before
Major Sheahan and Harshaw could work out a programme
another Indian sentry could be seen running
through the sage.</p>
<p>The sight of him was like that of a red rag to a bull.
Not waiting for orders, a dozen punchers instantly gave
chase. The rest of the party followed. Houck was in the
lead. Not far behind was Bob Dillon.</p>
<p>The mesa bench dropped sharply down a bare shale
scarp to the willows growing near the river. The Indian
camp below could be seen from the edge of the bluff.
But the rush to cut off the Ute was so impetuous that
the first riders could not check their horses. They
plunged down the bare slope at a headlong gallop.</p>
<p>Bob heard the ping of bullets as they sang past him.
He saw little spatters of sand flung up where they
struck. As his horse slithered down on its haunches
through the rubble, the man just in front of him dived
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
headlong from his horse. Bob caught one horrified
glimpse of him rolling over and clutching at his breast.
Next moment Dillon, too, was down. His mount had
been shot under him.</p>
<p>He jumped up and ran for the willows, crouching low
as he sped through the sage. Into the bushes he flung
himself and lay panting. He quaked with fear. Every
instant he expected to see the Utes rushing toward him.
His rifle was gone, lost in the fall. The hand that drew
the revolver from his belt trembled as with an ague.</p>
<p>Only a few of the riders had been unable to check
themselves on the edge of the bluff. The others had
now drawn back out of sight. A wounded horse lay
kicking on the slope. It was the one upon which Bob
had been mounted. The huddled figure of a man, with
head grotesquely twisted, sat astride a clump of brush.
Another sprawled on the hillside, arms and legs outflung.</p>
<p>Below, in the sage not far from the willows, another
body lay in the sand. This one moved. Bob could see
the man trying to hitch himself toward the shelter of
the river bushes. Evidently he was badly wounded, for
he made practically no progress. For a few minutes he
would lie still, then try once more to crawl forward.</p>
<p>The popping of guns had shifted farther to the right.
Bob judged that the rangers and soldiers were engaged
with the Indians somewhere on the ridge. Only a few
desultory shots came from the camp. But he knew it
would be only a question of time till some Ute caught
sight of the wounded man and picked him off as he lay
helpless in the open.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>Bob did not know who the wounded man was. He
might be Dud Hollister or Tom Reeves. Or perhaps
Blister Haines. Young Dillon sweated in agony. His
throat was parched. He felt horribly sick and weak, was
still shaking in a palsy of fear.</p>
<p>It was every man for himself now, he reasoned in his
terror. Perhaps he could creep through the willows and
escape up the river without being seen. He began to
edge slowly back.</p>
<p>But that man crouched in the sunshine, tied by his
wound to a spot where the Utes would certainly find
him sooner or later, fascinated Bob&#8217;s eyes and thoughts.
Suppose he left him there&mdash;and found out too late that
he had deserted Dud, abandoning him to almost certain
death. He could not do that. It would not be human.
What Dud would do in his place was not open to question.
He would go out and get the man and drag him to
the willows. But the danger of this appalled the cowpuncher.
The Utes would get him sure if he did. Even
if they did not hit him, he would be seen and later
stalked by the redskins.</p>
<p>After all there was no sense in throwing away another
life. Probably the wounded man would die anyhow.
Every fellow had to think of himself at a time like this.
It was not his fault the ranger was cut off and helpless.
He was no more responsible for him than were any of the
rest of the boys.</p>
<p>But it would not do. Bob could not by any sophistry
escape the duty thrust on him. The other boys were not
here. He was.</p>
<p>He groaned in desperation of spirit. He had to go and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
get the ranger who had been shot. That was all there
was to it. If he did not, he would be a yellow coyote.</p>
<p>Out of the precarious safety of the willows he crept on
hands and knees, still shaking in an ague of trepidation.
Of such cover as there was he availed himself. From one
sagebush to another he ran, head and body crouched
low. His last halt was back of some greasewood a
dozen yards from the ranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get you into the willows if I can,&#8221; he called in a
sibilant whisper. &#8220;You bad hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>The wounded man turned. &#8220;My laig&#8217;s busted&mdash;two
places. Plugged in the side too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s heart sank. The face into which he looked was
that of Jake Houck. If he had only known in time! But
it was too late now. He had to finish what he had begun.
He could not leave the fellow lying there.</p>
<p>He crawled to Houck. The big man gave directions.
&#8220;Better drag me, I reckon. Go as easy as you can on
that busted laig.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dillon took him beneath the arms and hauled him
through the sand. The wounded man set his teeth to
keep back a groan. Very slowly and carefully, an inch
here, a foot there, Bob worked Houck&#8217;s heavy body
backward. It was a long business. A dozen times he
stopped to select the next leg of the journey.</p>
<p>Beads of perspiration stood on Houck&#8217;s forehead. He
was in great pain, but he clenched his teeth and said
nothing. Bob could not deny him gameness. Not a
sound escaped his lips. He clung to his rifle even though
a free hand would greatly ease the jarring of the hurt
leg.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>Back of a scrub cottonwood Bob rested for a moment.
&#8220;Not far now,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Houck&#8217;s eyes measured the distance to the willows.
&#8220;No,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;Not far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think maybe I could carry you,&#8221; Bob suggested.
&#8220;Get you on my shoulder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might try,&#8221; the wounded man assented. &#8220;Laig
hurts like sixty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob helped him to his feet and from there to his
shoulder. He staggered over the rough ground to the
willows. Into these he pushed, still carrying Houck. As
gently as he could he lowered the big fellow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got me as I came over the bluff,&#8221; the Brown&#8217;s Park
man explained. &#8220;I was lucky at that. The Utes made a
good gather that time. Outa four of us they collected
two an&#8217; put me out of business. Howcome they not to
get you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shot my horse,&#8221; explained Bob. &#8220;I ducked into the
willows.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was hot in the willows. They were a young growth
and the trees were close. The sun beat down on the
thicket of saplings and no breeze penetrated it.</p>
<p>Houck panted. Already fever was beginning to burn
him up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hotter&#8217;n hell with the lid on,&#8221; he grumbled.
&#8220;Wisht I had some water.&#8221; He drew out a flask that
still had two fingers of whiskey in it, but he had resolution
enough not to drink. This would not help him.
&#8220;Reckon I better not take it,&#8221; he said regretfully.</p>
<p>Bob took the bandanna handkerchief from his throat
and soaked one end of it in the liquor. &#8220;Bathe yore
head,&#8221; he advised. &#8220;It&#8217;ll cool it fine.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>As the day grew older and the sun climbed the sky
vault the heat increased. No breath of air stirred. The
wounded man had moments of delirium in which he
moaned for water.</p>
<p>There was water, cool and fresh, not fifty yards from
them. He could hear the rushing river plunging toward
the Pacific, the gurgling of the stream as it dashed
against boulders and swept into whirlpools. But between
Bob and that precious water lay a stretch of
sandy wash which the Blanco covered when it was high.
One venturing to cross this would be an easy mark
for sharpshooters from the camp.</p>
<p>It seemed to him that the firing was now more distant.
There was a chance that none of the Utes were
still in the camp. Fever was mounting in Houck. He
was in much distress both from thirst and from the pain
of the wounds. Bob shrank from the pitiful appeals of
his high-pitched, delirious voice. The big fellow could
stand what he must with set jaws when he was sentient.
His craving found voice in irrational moments while he
had no control over his will. These were increasing in
frequency and duration.</p>
<p>Dillon picked up the flask. &#8220;Got to leave you a
while,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Back soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The glassy eyes of Houck glared at him. His mind
was wandering. &#8220;Torturin&#8217; me. Tha&#8217;s what you&#8217;re
doin&#8217;, you damned redskin,&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to get water,&#8221; explained Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tha&#8217;s a lie. You got water there&mdash;in that bottle.
Think I don&#8217;t know yore Apache ways?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob crept to the edge of the willows. From the foliage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
he peered out. Nobody was in sight. He could still see a
faint smoke rising from the Indian camp. But the firing
was a quarter of a mile away, at least. The bend of the
river was between him and the combatants.</p>
<p>Bob took his courage by the throat, drew a long
breath, and ran for the river. Just as he reached it a
bullet splashed in the current almost within hand&#8217;s
reach. The cowpuncher stooped and took two hasty
swallows into his dry mouth. He filled the bottle and
soaked the bandanna in the cold water. A slug of lead
spat at the sand close to his feet. A panic rose within
him. He got up and turned to go. Another bullet
struck a big rock four paces from where he was standing.
Bob scudded for the willows, his heart thumping
wildly with terror.</p>
<p>He plunged into the thicket, whipping himself with
the bending saplings in his headlong flight. Now that
they had discovered him, would the Indians follow him
to his hiding-place? Or would they wait till dusk and
creep up on him unseen? He wished he knew.</p>
<p>The water and the cool, wet bandanna alleviated the
misery of the wounded man. He shut his eyes, muttering
incoherently.</p>
<p>There was no longer any sound of firing. The long
silence alarmed Bob. Was it possible that his friends
had been driven off? Or that they had retired from the
field under the impression that all of the riders who had
plunged over the bluff had been killed?</p>
<p>This fear obsessed him. It rode him like an old man of
the sea. He could not wait here till the Utes came to
murder him and Houck. Down in the bottom of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
heart he knew that he could not leave this enemy of his
to the fate that would befall him. The only thing to do
was to go for help at once.</p>
<p>He took off his coat and put it under Houck&#8217;s head.
He moistened the hot bandanna for the burning forehead
and poured the rest of the water down the throat
of the sick man. The rifle he left with Houck. It would
only impede him while he was crossing the mesa.</p>
<p>None of us know what we can do till the test comes.
Bob felt it was physically impossible for him to venture
into the open again and try to reach his friends. He
might at any instant run plumb into the Utes. Nevertheless
he crept out from the willows into the sage
desert.</p>
<p>The popping of the guns had begun again. The battle
seemed to be close to the edge of the mesa round the
bend of the river. Bob swung wide, climbing the bluff
from the farther skirt of the willows. He reached the
mesa.</p>
<p>From where he lay he could see that the whites held a
ridge two hundred yards away. The Utes were apparently
in the river valley.</p>
<p>He moved forward warily, every sense abnormally
keyed to service. A clump of wild blackberries grew on
the rim of the bluff. From this smoke billowed. Bullets
began to zip past Bob. He legged it for the ridge, blind
to everything but his desperate need to escape.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<h3>&#8220;KEEP A-COMIN&#8217;, RED HAID&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>When the rangers and the militia stampeded after the
Indian scout, Dud Hollister was examining the hoof
of his mount. He swung instantly to the saddle and
touched his pony with the spur. It shot across the
mesa on the outskirts of the troop. Not impeded by
riders in front, Dud reached the bluff above the river
valley on the heels of the advance guard. He pulled up
just in time to keep from plunging over.</p>
<p>The Utes, under cover of the willow saplings, were
concentrating a very heavy fire on the bluff and slope
below. Dud&#8217;s first thought was that the troops had been
drawn into a trap. Every man who had been carried
over the edge of the mesa by the impetus of the charge
was already unhorsed. Several were apparently dead.
One was scudding for cover.</p>
<p>Dud drew back promptly. He did not care to stand
silhouetted against the sky-line for sharpshooters. Nobody
had ever accused the Utes of being good shots,
but at that distance they could hardly miss him if he
stayed.</p>
<p>The soldiers and rangers gathered in a small clump of
cottonwoods. Harshaw read his boys the riot act.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine business,&#8221; he told them bitterly. &#8220;Every last
one of you acted like he was a tenderfoot. Ain&#8217;t you ever
seen a Ute before? Tryin&#8217; to collect him so anxious, an&#8217;
him only bait to lead you on. I reckon we better go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
home an&#8217; let Major Sheahan&#8217;s boys do this job. I&#8217;m
plumb disgusted with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The range-riders looked at each other out of the corners
of meek eyes. This rebuke was due them. They
had been warned against letting themselves be drawn on
without orders.</p>
<p>&#8220;That fellow Houck he started it,&#8221; Big Bill suggested
humbly by way of defense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you drug into it? Did he rope you off yore
horse an&#8217; take you along with him?&#8221; demanded Harshaw
sarcastically. &#8220;Well, I hope you got yore lesson.
How many did we lose?&#8221;</p>
<p>A roll-call showed four missing. Hollister felt a catch
at the throat when his riding partner failed to report.
Bob must be one of those who had gone over the ledge.</p>
<p>One of Sheahan&#8217;s troopers on scout duty reported.
&#8220;Indians making for a gulch at the end of the willows,
sir. Others swarming up into the bushes at the edge of
the mesa.&#8221;</p>
<p>A cowpuncher familiar with the country volunteered
information. &#8220;Gulch leads to that ridge over there. It&#8217;s
the highest point around here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;d better take the ridge,&#8221; Harshaw suggested
to Sheahan. &#8220;Right quick, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The major agreed.</p>
<p>They put the troop in motion. Another scout rode in.
The Utes were hurrying as fast as they could to the
rock-rim. Major Sheahan quickened the pace to a gallop.
The Indians lying in the bushes fired at them as
they went.</p>
<p>Tom Reeves went down, his horse shot under him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
Dud pulled up, a hundred yards away. Out of the
bushes braves poured like buzzing bees. The dismounted
man would be cut off.</p>
<p>Hollister wheeled his cowpony in its tracks and went
back. He slipped a foot from the stirrup and held it out
as a foot-rest for Reeves. The Utes whooped as they
came on. The firing was very heavy. The pony, a
young one, danced wildly and made it impossible for
Tom to swing up.</p>
<p>Dud dismounted. The panicky horse backed away,
eyes filled with terror. It rose into the air, trembling.
Dud tried to coax it to good behavior.</p>
<p>The moments were flying, bringing the Utes nearer
every instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;We gotta make a run for it, Dud,&#8221; his companion
said hurriedly. &#8220;To the willows over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no choice. Hollister let go the bridle and
ran. Scarcely fifty yards behind them came the Utes.</p>
<p>Even in their high-heeled boots the cowpunchers ran
fast. Once within the shelter of the willows they turned
and opened fire. This quite altered the situation. The
foremost brave faltered in his pigeon-toed stride, stopped
abruptly, and dived for the shelter of a sagebush. The
others veered off to the right. They disappeared into
some blackberry bushes on the edge of the mesa.
Whether from here they continued to the valley the
punchers in the willows could not tell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some lucky getaway,&#8221; Dud panted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought I was a goner sure when they plugged my
bronc,&#8221; said Reeves.</p>
<p>He took a careful shot at the sagebush behind which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
the Indian had taken refuge. The Ute ran away limping.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow, that guy&#8217;s got a souvenir to remember me
by. Compliments of Tom Reeves,&#8221; grinned the owner
of that name.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get back to the boys somehow. I
reckon they&#8217;re havin&#8217; quite a party on the ridge,&#8221; Dud
said.</p>
<p>The sound of brisk firing came across the mesa to
them. It was evident that the whites and redskins had
met on the ridge and were disputing for possession of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;My notion is we&#8217;d better stick around here for a
while,&#8221; Reeves demurred. &#8220;I kinda hate to hoof it
acrost the flat an&#8217; be a target the whole darned way.&#8221;</p>
<p>This seemed good to Hollister. The troopers seemed
to be holding their own. They had not been driven
back. The smoke of their rifles showed along the very
summit of the rock-rim. The inference was that the
Utes had been forced to fall back.</p>
<p>The two rangers lay in the willows for hours. The
firing had died down, recommenced, and again ceased.
Once there came the sound of shots from the right,
down in the valley close by the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re likely gettin&#8217; the fellow that wasn&#8217;t killed
when he went over the bluff,&#8221; Dud suggested. &#8220;There
ain&#8217;t a thing we can do to help him either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, I reckon. They&#8217;re collectin&#8217; him now.
Wonder which of the boys it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dud felt a twinge of conscience. There was nothing
he could do to help the man hemmed in on the riverbank,
but it hurt him to lie there without attempting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
aid. The ranger making the lone fight might be Bob
Dillon, poor Bob who had to whip his courage to keep
himself from playing the weakling. Dud hoped not. He
did not like to think of his riding mate in such desperate
straits with no hope of escape.</p>
<p>The battle on the ridge had begun again. Hollister
and Reeves decided to try to rejoin their friends. From
the north end of the willows they crept into a small draw
that led away from the river toward the hills beyond the
mesa. Both of them were experienced plainsmen. They
knew how to make the most of such cover as there was.
As they moved through the sage, behind hillocks and
along washes, they detoured to put as much distance as
possible between them and the Utes at the edge of the
bench.</p>
<p>But the last hundred yards had to be taken in the
open. They did it under fire, on the run, with a dozen
riflemen aiming at them from the fringe of blackberry
bushes that bordered the mesa. Up the ridge they went
pell-mell, Reeves limping the last fifty feet of the way.
An almost spent bullet had struck him in the fleshy part
of the lower leg.</p>
<p>Hawks let out a cowboy yell at sight of them,
jumped up, and pulled Dud down beside him among the
boulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never expected to see you lads again alive an&#8217;
kickin&#8217; after you an&#8217; the Utes started that footrace. I&#8217;ll
bet neither one of you throwed down on yoreself when
you was headin&#8217; for the willows. Gee, I&#8217;m plumb glad
to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re right glad to be here, Buck,&#8221; acknowledged
Dud. &#8220;What&#8217;s new?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We got these birds goin&#8217;, looks like. In about an
hour now we&#8217;re allowin&#8217; to hop down into the gulch real
sudden an&#8217; give &#8217;em merry hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dud reported to Harshaw. The cattleman dropped
a hand on his rider&#8217;s shoulder with a touch of affection.
He was very fond of the gay young fellow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought they&#8217;d bumped you off, boy. Heap much
glad to see you. What do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon nothing that you don&#8217;t. There was firin&#8217;
down by the river. Looks like they found one o&#8217; the
boys who went over the bluff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; there&#8217;s a bunch of &#8217;em strung out among the
bushes close to the edge of the mesa. Fifteen or twenty,
would you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Must be that many, the way their bullets dropped
round Tom an&#8217; me just now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom much hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Flesh wound only&mdash;in the laig.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harshaw nodded. His mind was preoccupied with the
problem before them. &#8220;The bulk of &#8217;em are down in
this gulch back of the ridge. We met &#8217;em on the summit
and drove &#8217;em back. I judge they&#8217;ve had a-plenty.
We&#8217;ll rout &#8217;em out soon now.&#8221;</p>
<p>A brisk fire went on steadily between the Utes in the
gulch and the whites on the ridge. Every man had
found such cover as he could, but the numbers on both
sides made it impossible for all to remain wholly hidden.
The casualties among the troopers had been, however,
very light since the first disastrous rush over the bluff.</p>
<p>Dud caught Harshaw&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Look!&#8221; he cried,
keenly excited.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>A man had emerged from the bushes and was running
across the flat toward the ridge. Dud and Tom had kept
well away toward the foothills, not out of range of the
Utes, but far enough distant to offer poor targets. But
this man was running the gauntlet of a heavy fire close
enough to be an easy mark. Blanco valley settlers, expert
marksmen from much big-game hunting, would
have dropped the runner before he had covered thirty
yards. But the Indians were armed with cheap trade
guns and were at best poor shots. The runner kept coming.</p>
<p>Those on the ridge watched him, their pulses quick,
their nerves taut. For he was running a race with death.
Every instant they expected to see him fall. From the
bushes jets of smoke puffed like toy balloons continuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fire where you see the smoke, boys,&#8221; Harshaw
shouted.</p>
<p>The rangers and militia concentrated on the fringe of
shrubbery. At least they could make it hot enough for
the Indians to disturb their aims.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s down!&#8221; groaned Hollister.</p>
<p>He was, but in a second he was up once more, still
running strong. He had stumbled over a root. The sage
was heavy here. This served as a partial screen for the
swiftly moving man. Every step now was carrying him
farther from the sharpshooters, bringing him closer to
the ridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Godfrey, he&#8217;ll make it!&#8221; Harshaw cried.</p>
<p>It began to look that way. The bullets were still falling
all around him, but he was close to the foot of the ridge.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>Dud made a discovery. &#8220;It&#8217;s Bob Dillon!&#8221; he
shouted. Then, to the runner, with all his voice, &#8220;Keep
a-comin&#8217;, Red Haid!&#8221;</p>
<p>The hat had gone from the red head. As he climbed
the slope the runner was laboring heavily. Dud ran
down the hill to meet him, half a dozen others at his
heels, among them Blister. They caught the spent
youth under the arms and round the body. So he
reached the crest.</p>
<p>Blister&#8217;s fat arms supported him as his body swayed.
The wheezy voice of the justice trembled. &#8220;G-glory be,
son. I &#8217;most had heart f-failure whilst you was hoofin&#8217;
it over the mesa. Oh, boy! I&#8217;m g-glad to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob sat down and panted for breath. &#8220;I got to go&mdash;back
again,&#8221; he whispered from a dry throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; demanded Harshaw. &#8220;Back where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To&mdash;to the river. I came to get help&mdash;for Houck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Houck?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s down there in the willows wounded.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<h3>AN OBSTINATE MAN STANDS PAT</h3>
</div>

<p>A moment of blank silence fell on the little group
crouched among the boulders. Bob&#8217;s statement that he
had to go back through the fire zone&mdash;to Houck&mdash;had
fallen among them like a mental bombshell.</p>
<p>Blister was the first to find his voice. &#8220;You been
down there l-lookin&#8217; after him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. They hit him in the leg&mdash;twice. An&#8217; once in
the side. He&#8217;s outa his head. I got him water from the
river.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that when I heard shootin&#8217; down there?&#8221; Dud
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be d-dawg-goned!&#8221; Blister exclaimed.</p>
<p>Of life&#8217;s little ironies he had never seen a stranger example
than this. It had fallen to Bob Dillon to look after
his bitter enemy, to risk his life for him, to traverse a
battle-field under heavy fire in order to get help for him.
His mind flashed back to the boy he had met less than a
year ago, a pallid, trembling weakling who had shriveled
under the acid test of danger. He had traveled a long
way since then in self-conquest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Houck was down in the open last I seen him,&#8221;
Hawks said. &#8220;Did he crawl to the willows?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I kinda helped him,&#8221; Bob said, a little ashamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmp! An&#8217; now you think we&#8217;d ought to let two-three
men get shot going after him across the mesa,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
Harshaw said. &#8220;Nothin&#8217; doing. Not right away anyhow.
Houck&#8217;s foolishness got him into the hole where he
is. He&#8217;ll have to wait till we clean out this nest in the
gulch. Soon as we&#8217;ve done that we&#8217;ll go after him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the Utes will rush the willows,&#8221; Bob protested
mildly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, but he&#8217;ll have to take his chance of that.
Any of the rest of us would in his place. You&#8217;ve done
what you could, son. That lets you out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m going back,&#8221; Bob said quietly. &#8220;I told him
I would. I got to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t be r-right sensible, would it?&#8221; asked
Blister. &#8220;N-not right away anyhow. After we get those
b-birds outa the blackberry bushes, time enough then
for you to h-hit the back trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I promised.&#8221; There was in Bob&#8217;s face a look
Blister had never seen there before, something hard and
dogged and implacable. &#8220;My notion is for half a dozen of
us to go on horses&mdash;swing round by the far edge of the
mesa. We can drop down into the valley an&#8217; pick Houck
up if we&#8217;re lucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you&#8217;re not lucky?&#8221; Harshaw demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, o&#8217; course we might have trouble. Got to take
our chances on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They might wipe the whole bunch of you out. No,
sir. I need my men right here. This whole thing&#8217;s comin&#8217;
to a show-down right soon. Houck will have to wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got to go back, Mr. Harshaw,&#8221; Bob insisted. &#8220;I
done promised him I would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looky here, boy. You&#8217;ll do as you please, of course.
But there&#8217;s no sense in being bull-haided. How much do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
you figure you owe this Jake Houck? I never heard tell
he was yore best friend. You got him into the willows.
You went to the river and brought him water. You ran
a big risk comin&#8217; here to get help for him. We&#8217;ll go to
him just as soon as it&#8217;s safe. That ought to content you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Bob&#8217;s mental vision there flashed a picture of a
man in fever burning up for lack of water. He could not
understand it himself. It was not reasonable, of course.
But somehow Jake Houck had become his charge. He
had to go through with the job.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back to him,&#8221; he said stubbornly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re a darn fool. He wouldn&#8217;t go a step of
the way for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe not. That ain&#8217;t the point. He needs me. Do
I get a horse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if you&#8217;re bound an&#8217; determined to go,&#8221; Harshaw
said. After a momentary hesitation he added:
&#8220;And if any of the boys want to go along they can. I&#8217;m
not hinderin&#8217; them. But my advice is for them to stick
right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s eyes swept the little group round him. &#8220;Any
one want to take a chance? We&#8217;ll snake Houck outa the
willows an&#8217; make a getaway sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or else you&#8217;ll stay there with him permanent,&#8221;
Harshaw contributed. &#8220;It&#8217;s plumb foolishness, boys.
Houck had his orders an&#8217; he broke away from them
deliberate. He&#8217;d ought to take what&#8217;s comin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dud pleaded with Dillon. &#8220;If it was anybody but
Houck, Bob, I&#8217;d trail along with you. I sure would. But
I can&#8217;t see as there&#8217;s any call for us to take such a big
risk for him. He&#8217;s got it in for us both. Said himself he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
was layin&#8217; for us. You stood by him to a fare-you-well.
Ain&#8217;t that enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob did not attempt to reason. He simply stated
facts. &#8220;No, I got to go back, Dud. He&#8217;s a mighty sick
man, an&#8217; he needs me. The Utes are liable to find him
any time. Maybe I could stand &#8217;em off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; maybe you couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; Blister said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
plumb s-suicide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dillon looked at his fat friend with a faint, dreary
smile. He did not himself relish the task before him.
&#8220;Thought you told me to be a wolf, to hop to it every
chance I got to do some crazy thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blister hedged. &#8220;Oh, well, a f-fellow wants to have
some sense. I never see a good thing that couldn&#8217;t be
r-run into the ground. Far as I know, I never told you
to stand on the D. &amp; R. G. tracks an&#8217; try to stop the
express with yore head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to be going now,&#8221; Bob said. He turned to
Harshaw. &#8220;Where&#8217;s that bronc I get to carry me back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Up there in the piñons. Dud, you see he gets a good
one. I&#8217;m wishin&#8217; you luck, son. An&#8217; I&#8217;ll say one thing
right out in meetin&#8217;. You&#8217;re a better man than Lou Harshaw.&#8221;
The cattleman&#8217;s hand gripped that of Dillon
firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks! Tha&#8217;s foolishness,&#8221; Bob murmured, embarrassed.
&#8220;I&#8217;m scared stiff if you want to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re aimin&#8217; for to make a
target of yorese&#8217;f again,&#8221; Hawks suggested ironically.
&#8220;Damn &#8217;f I&#8217;d do it for the best man alive, let alone
Jake Houck. No, sir. I&#8217;ll go a reasonable way, but I
quit this side of suicide. I sure do.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>Over to the left rifles were still popping, but at this
point of the ridge the firing had temporarily died down.
Bob Dillon was the center of interest.</p>
<p>A second time his eye traveled over the group about
him. &#8220;Last call for volunteers, boys. Anybody want to
take a ride?&#8221;</p>
<p>Blister found in that eye some compelling quality of
leadership. &#8220;Dawg-gone you, I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; his high falsetto
piped.</p>
<p>Bob shook his head. &#8220;Not you, Blister. You&#8217;re too
fat. We&#8217;re liable to have to travel fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody else offered himself as a sacrifice. There were
men present who would have taken a chance for a friend,
but they would not do it for Houck.</p>
<p>Dud went with Bob to the piñons. While Dillon saddled
one horse, Hollister put the bridle on a second.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that for?&#8221; Bob asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m soft in the haid,&#8221; Dud grunted. &#8220;Gonna
trail along. I&#8217;ll tell you right now I ain&#8217;t lost Houck any,
but if you&#8217;re set on this fool business, why, I&#8217;ll take a
whirl with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good old Dud,&#8221; Bob beamed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet we get
away with it fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Crazy old Dud,&#8221; the owner of the name grumbled.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet we get our topknots scalped.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode down from the rim-rock, bearing to the
right, as far away from the river as possible. The Utes
in the blackberry fringe caught sight of them and concentrated
their fire on the galloping horsemen. Presently
the riders dipped for a minute behind a swell of
ground.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A heap more comfortable ridin&#8217; here,&#8221; Dud said,
easing his horse for a few moments to a slower pace. &#8220;I
never did know before why the good Lord made so much
of this country stand up on end, but if I get outa this
hole I&#8217;ll not kick at travelin&#8217; over hills so frequent. They
sure got their uses when Injuns are pluggin&#8217; at you.&#8221;</p>
<p>They made as wide a circuit as the foothills would allow.
At times they were under a brisk fire as they cantered
through the sage. This increased when they swung
across the mesa toward the river. Fortunately they were
now almost out of range.</p>
<p>Riding along the edge of the bluff, they found a
place where their sure-footed cowponies could slide and
scramble down. In the valley, as they dashed across to
the willows where Bob had left Houck, they were again
under fire. Even after they had plunged into the thicket
of saplings they could hear bullets zipping through the
foliage to right and left.</p>
<p>The glazed eyes in Houck&#8217;s flushed face did not recognize
the punchers. Defiance glowered in his stare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d you get the notion, you red devils, that
Jake Houck is a quitter? Torment me, will you? Burn
me up with thirst, eh? Go to it an&#8217; see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob took a step or two toward the wounded man.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know me, Houck? We&#8217;ve come to look after
you. This is Dud Hollister. You know him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What if I did gun him?&#8221; the high-pitched voice
maundered on. &#8220;Tried to steal my bronc, he did, an&#8217; I
wouldn&#8217;t stand for it a minute.... All right. Light
yore fires. Burn me up, you hounds of Hades. I&#8217;m not
askin&#8217; no favors. Not none a-tall.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>The big man&#8217;s hand groped at his belt. Brown fingers
closed on the butt of a forty-five. Instantly both rescuers
were galvanized to life. Dud&#8217;s foot scraped into
the air a cloud of sand and dust as Bob dived forward.
He plunged at Houck a fraction of a second behind his
friend.</p>
<p>Into the blue sky a bullet went singing. Bob had been
in time to knock the barrel of the revolver up with his
outflung hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<h3>THREE IN A PIT</h3>
</div>

<p>Wounded though he was, Houck managed to make a
good deal of trouble for the punchers before they pinned
him down and took the forty-five from him. His great
strength was still at command, and he had the advantage
that neither of his rescuers wanted to injure him
during the struggle. They thrashed over the ground,
arms and legs outflung wildly. Houck gave up only
when his vigor collapsed.</p>
<p>His surrender was complete. He lay weak and panting,
bleeding from reopened wounds, for the time as
helpless and submissive as a child.</p>
<p>From a canteen they gave him water. Afterward they
washed and tied up the wounds, bathed the fevered face,
and kept the mosquitoes from him by fanning them
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Expect I&#8217;d better take a pasear an&#8217; see where Mr.
Ute&#8217;s at,&#8221; Dud said. &#8220;He&#8217;s liable to drap in onexpected
while we&#8217;re not lookin&#8217;&mdash;several of him, huntin&#8217; for
souvenirs in the scalp line for to decorate his belt with.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the little opening he crept into the thicket of
saplings and disappeared. Bob waited beside the delirious
man. His nerves were keyed to a high tension. For
all he knew the beadlike eyes of four or five sharpshooters
might be peering at him from the jungle.</p>
<p>The sound of a shot startled him. It came from the
direction in which Dud had gone. Had he been killed?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
Or wounded? Bob could not remain longer where he
was. He too crept into the willows, following as well as
he could the path of Hollister.</p>
<p>There came to him presently the faint crackle of twigs.
Some one or something was moving in the bosk. He lay
still, heart thumping violently. The sound ceased, began
again.</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s trembling hand held a revolver pointed in the
direction of the snapping branches. The willows moved,
opened up, and a blond, curly head appeared.</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s breath was expelled in a long sigh of relief.
&#8220;Wow! I&#8217;m glad to see you. Heard that shot an&#8217;
thought maybe they&#8217;d got you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so you can notice it,&#8221; Dud replied cheerfully.
&#8220;But they&#8217;re all round us. I took a crack at one inquisitive
buck who had notions of collectin&#8217; me. He
ce&#8217;tainly hit the dust sudden as he vamosed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I found a kinda buffalo wallow in the willows. We&#8217;ll
move in on a lease an&#8217; sit tight till Harshaw an&#8217; the boys
show up.&#8221;</p>
<p>They carried and dragged Houck through the thicket
to the saucer-shaped opening Hollister had discovered.
The edges of this rose somewhat above the surrounding
ground. Using their spurs to dig with, the cowpunchers
deepened the hollow and packed the loose dirt around
the rim in order to heighten the rampart.</p>
<p>From a distance came the sound of heavy, rapid firing,
of far, faint yells.</p>
<p>&#8220;The boys are attackin&#8217; the gulch,&#8221; Dud guessed.
&#8220;Sounds like they might be makin&#8217; a clean-up too.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>It was three o&#8217;clock by Bob&#8217;s big silver watch. Heat
waves were shimmering in the hollow and mosquitoes
singing. Occasionally Houck&#8217;s voice rose in delirious
excitement. Sometimes he thought the Utes were torturing
him. Again he lived over scenes in the past.
Snatches of babble carried back to the days of his turbulent
youth when all men&#8217;s cattle were his. In the mutterings
born of a sick brain Bob heard presently the name
of June.</p>
<p>&#8220;... Tell you I&#8217;ve took a fancy to you. Tell you
Jake Houck gets what he wants. No sense you rarin&#8217;
around, June. I&#8217;m yore man.... Mine, girl. Don&#8217;t you
ever forget it. Mine for keeps.... Use that gun, damn
you, or crawl into a hole. I&#8217;m takin&#8217; yore wife from you.
Speak yore piece. Tell her to go with me. Ha! Ha! Ha!&#8221;</p>
<p>The firing came nearer.</p>
<p>Again Dud guessed what was taking place. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
got the Utes outa the gulch an&#8217; are drivin&#8217; them down
the valley. Right soon they&#8217;re liable to light on us hard.
Depends on how much the boys are pressin&#8217; them.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had two rifles and four revolvers, for Houck
had lately become a two-gun man. These they examined
carefully to make sure they were in order. The
defenders crouched back to back in the pit, each of them
searching the thicket for an angle of one hundred and
eighty degrees.</p>
<p>The sound of the battle died down. Evidently the
pursuers were out of contact with the natives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t like that,&#8221; Dud said. &#8220;If the Utes have time
they&#8217;ll try to pick us up as they&#8217;re passin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob fired.</p>
<p>&#8220;See one?&#8221; asked his friend.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Think so. Something moved. Down in that hollow.
He&#8217;s outa sight now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got us located, then. Old Man Trouble
headed this way. Something liable to start. Soon now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The minutes dragged. Bob&#8217;s eyes blurred from the
intensity with which he watched.</p>
<p>A bullet struck the edge of the pit. Bob ducked involuntarily.
Presently there was a second shot&mdash;and a
third.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re gettin&#8217; warm,&#8221; Dud said.</p>
<p>He and Bob fired at the smoke puffs, growing now
more frequent. Both of them knew it would be only a
short time till one of them was hit unless their friends
came to the rescue. Spurts of sand flew every few moments.</p>
<p>There was another undesirable prospect. The Utes
might charge and capture the pit, wiping out the defenders.
To prevent this the cowpunchers kept up as
lively a fire as possible.</p>
<p>From down the valley came the sound of scattered
shots and yells. Dud swung his hat in glee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good boys! They&#8217;re comin&#8217; in on the rear. Hi yi
yippy yi!&#8221;</p>
<p>Firing began again on the other side. The Utes were
caught between the rangers to the left and the soldiers
to the right. Bob could see them breaking through the
willows toward the river. It was an easy guess that their
horses were bunched here and that they would be forced
to cross the stream to escape.</p>
<p>Five minutes later Harshaw broke through the saplings
to the pit. &#8220;Either of you boys hurt?&#8221; he demanded
anxiously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not a scratch on either of us,&#8221; Dud reported.</p>
<p>The boss of the Slash Lazy D wrung their hands.
&#8220;By Godfrey! I&#8217;m plumb pleased. Couldn&#8217;t get it outa
my head that they&#8217;d got you lads. How&#8217;s Houck?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s right sick. Doc had ought to look after him
soon. He&#8217;s had one mighty bad day of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Houck was carried on a blanket to the riverbank,
where camp was being made for the night. The Utes
had been routed. It was estimated that ten or twelve
of them had been killed, though the number could not be
verified, as Indians always if possible carry away their
dead. For the present, at least, no further pursuit of
them was feasible.</p>
<p>Dr. Tuckerman dressed the wounds of the Brown&#8217;s
Park man and looked after the others who had been
hurt. All told, the whites had lost four killed. Five were
wounded more or less seriously.</p>
<p>The wagons had been left on the mesa three miles
away. Houck was taken here next day on a stretcher
made of a blanket tied to willow poles. The bodies of the
dead were also removed.</p>
<p>Two days later the rangers reached Bear Cat. They
had left the soldiers to complete the task of rounding
up the Utes and taking them back to the reservation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
<h3>A HERO IS EMBARRASSED</h3>
</div>

<p>Following the Ute War, as it came to be called, there
was a period of readjustment on the Rio Blanco. The
whites had driven off the horses and the stock of the Indians.
Two half-grown boys appropriated a flock of several
thousand sheep belonging to the Indians and took
them to Glenwood Springs. On the way they sold the
sheep right and left. The asking price was a dollar. The
selling price was twenty-five cents, a watermelon, a
slice of pie, or a jack-knife with a broken blade.</p>
<p>The difficulties that ensued had to be settled. To get
a better understanding of the situation the Governor of
the State and a general of the United States Army with
their staffs visited the White River country. While in
Bear Cat they put up at the hotel.</p>
<p>Mollie did a land-office business, but she had no time
to rest day or night. Passing through the office during
the rush of the dinner hour, she caught sight of Blister
Haines sprawled on two chairs. He was talking with
Bob Dillon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear you done quit the Slash Lazy D outfit. What&#8217;s
the idee?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; in ridin&#8217;,&#8221; Bob told him. &#8220;A fellow had
ought to get a piece of land on the river an&#8217; run some
cattle of his own. Me an&#8217; Dud aim to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmp! An&#8217; meanwhile?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re rip-rappin&#8217; the river for old man Wilson.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>Blister was pleased, but he did not say so. &#8220;Takes a
good man to start on a s-shoestring an&#8217; make it go with
cattle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re going into it,&#8221; Bob modestly explained.</p>
<p>Mollie broke in. &#8220;What are you boys loafin&#8217; here for
when I need help in the dining-room? Can either of you
sling hash?&#8221;</p>
<p>The fat man derricked himself out of the chairs. &#8220;We
can. L-lead us to the job, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it happened that Blister, in a white apron, presently
stood before the Governor ready to take orders.
The table was strewn with used dishes and food, débris
left there by previous diners. The amateur waiter was
not sure whether the Governor and his staff had eaten
or were ready to eat.</p>
<p>&#8220;D-do you want a r-reloadin&#8217; outfit?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>The general, seated beside the Governor, had lived his
life in the East. He stared at Blister in surprise, for at a
council held only an hour before this ample waiter had
been the chief spokesman in behalf of fair play to the
Indians. He decided that the dignified thing to do was
to fail to recognize the man.</p>
<p>Blister leaned toward the Governor and whispered
confidentially. &#8220;Say, Gov, take my tip an&#8217; try one o&#8217;
these here steaks. They ain&#8217;t from dogy stock.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Governor had been a cattleman himself. The free-and-easy
ways of the West did not disturb him. &#8220;Go
you once, Blister,&#8221; he assented.</p>
<p>The waiter turned beaming on the officer. His fat
hand rested on the braided shoulder. &#8220;How about you,
Gen? Does that go d-double?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>Upon Blister was turned the cold, hard eye of West
Point. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take a tenderloin steak, sir, done medium.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll sure find it&#8217;ll s-stick to yore ribs,&#8221; Blister
said cheerfully.</p>
<p>Carrying a tray full of dishes, Bob went into the
kitchen choking down his mirth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blister&#8217;s liable to be shot at daybreak. He&#8217;s lessie-majesting
the U.S. Army.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chung Lung shuffled to the door and peered through.
Internal mirth struggled with his habitual gravity.
&#8220;Gleat smoke, Blister spill cup cloffee on general.&#8221;</p>
<p>This fortunately turned out to be an exaggeration.
Blister, in earnest conversation with himself, had merely
overturned a half-filled cup on the table in the course
of one of his gestures.</p>
<p>Mollie retired him from service.</p>
<p>Alone with Bob for a moment in the kitchen, June
whispered to him hurriedly. &#8220;Before you an&#8217; Dud go
away I want to see you a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to see me an&#8217; Dud?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>She flashed a look of shy reproach at him. &#8220;No, not
Dud&mdash;you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob stayed to help wipe the dishes. It was a job at
which he had been adept in the old days when he flunkied
for the telephone outfit. Afterward he and June
slipped out of the back door and walked down to the
river.</p>
<p>June had rehearsed exactly what she meant to say to
him, but now that the moment had arrived it did not
seem so easy. He might mistake her friendliness. He
might think there was some unexpressed motive in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
back of her mind, that she was trying to hold him to the
compact made in Blister Haines&#8217;s office a year ago. It
would be hateful if he thought that. But she had to risk
it if their comradeship was going to mean anything.
When folks were friends they helped each other, didn&#8217;t
they? Told each other how glad they were when any
piece of good luck came. And what had come to Bob
Dillon was more than good luck. It was a bit of splendid
achievement that made her generous blood sing.</p>
<p>This was all very well, but as they moved under the
cottonwoods across the grass tessellated with sunshine
and shadow, the fact of sex thrust itself up and embarrassed
her. She resented this, was impatient at it, yet
could not escape it. Beneath the dusky eyes a wave of
color crept into the dark cheeks.</p>
<p>Though they walked in silence, Bob did not guess her
discomposure. As clean of line as a boy, she carried herself
resiliently. He thought her beautiful as a wild
flower. The lift and tender curve of the chin, the swell
of the forearms above the small brown hands that had
done so much hard work so competently, filled him with
a strange delight. She had emerged from the awkwardness
and heaviness of the hoydenish age. It was difficult
for him to identify her with the Cinderella of Piceance
Creek except by the eager flash of the eyes in those moments
when her spirit seemed to be rushing toward him.</p>
<p>They stood on the bank above the edge of the ford.
June looked down into the tumbling water. Bob waited
for her to speak. He had achieved a capacity for silence
and had learned the strength of it.</p>
<p>Presently June lifted her eyes to his. &#8220;Dud says you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
an&#8217; he are going to take up preëmptions and run cattle
of your own,&#8221; she began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Harshaw&#8217;s going to stake us. We&#8217;ll divide the
increase.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad. Dud ought to quit going rippity-cut
every which way. No use his wastin&#8217; five or six years
before he gets started for himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Bob assented.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re steadier than he is. You&#8217;ll hold him down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob came to time loyally. &#8220;Dud&#8217;s all right. You&#8217;ll
find him there like a rock when you need him. Best fellow
in all this White River country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her shining eyes sent a stab of pain through his heart.
She was smiling at him queerly. &#8220;One of the best,&#8221; she
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay with you to a fare-you-well,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;If I
knew a girl&mdash;if I had a sister&mdash;well, I&#8217;d sure trust her
to Dud Hollister. All wool an&#8217; a yard wide that boy is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; June murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Game as they make &#8217;em. Know where he&#8217;s at every
turn of the road. I&#8217;d ce&#8217;tainly back his play to a finish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Best old pal a fellow ever had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really a pity you haven&#8217;t a sister,&#8221; she teased.</p>
<p>Bob guessed that June had brought him here to talk
about Dud. He did, to the exclusion of all other topics.
The girl listened gravely and patiently, but imps of mischief
were kicking up their heels in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You give him a good recommendation,&#8221; she said at
last. &#8220;How about his friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Reeves?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, Bob Dillon.&#8221; Her dark eyes met his fairly.
&#8220;Oh, Bob, I&#8217;m <i>so</i> glad.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was suddenly flooded with self-consciousness.
&#8220;About us preëmptin&#8217;?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. About you being the hero of the campaign.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ranger was miserably happy. He was ashamed to
have the thing he had done dragged into the light, embarrassed
to hear her use so casually a word that made
him acutely uncomfortable. Yet he would not for the
world have missed the queer little thrills that raced
through him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s plumb foolishness,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is&mdash;not. Think I haven&#8217;t heard all about
it? How you dragged Jake Houck into the willows
right spang from among the Utes? How you went to
the river an&#8217; got him water? How you went for help
when everybody thought you&#8217;d be killed? An&#8217; how
you shamed Dud into going back with you? I made
Mr. Harshaw tell me all he knew&mdash;and Dud too. He
said&mdash;Mr. Harshaw said&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob interrupted this eager attack. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you how
it was, June. When I saw Houck lying out there with a
busted leg I didn&#8217;t know who he was&mdash;thought maybe
it was Dud. So I had to go an&#8217; get him. If I&#8217;d known
it was Houck&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew it was Houck before you dragged him
back, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; she charged. &#8220;You knew it when
you went to the river to get him water?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Truth is, I was scared so I shook,&#8221; he confessed
humbly. &#8220;But when a fellow&#8217;s sufferin&#8217; like Jake
Houck was&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Even your enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, enemies don&#8217;t count when you&#8217;re fightin&#8217;
Utes together. I had to look after him&mdash;couldn&#8217;t
duck it. Different with Dud when he rode back to get
Tom Reeves. Did you hear about that?&#8221;</p>
<p>She put a damper on the sudden enthusiasm that
lilted into his voice. &#8220;Yes, I heard about that,&#8221; she said
dryly. &#8220;But we&#8217;re talking of another man now. You&#8217;ve
got to stand there an&#8217; take it, Bob. It won&#8217;t last but a
minute anyhow. I never was so tickled in my life before.
When I thought of all you&#8217;ve suffered an&#8217; gone
through, an&#8217; how now you&#8217;ve stopped the tongues of all
the folks who jeered at you, I went to my room and
cried like a little girl. You&#8217;ll understand, won&#8217;t you? I
had to tell you this because we&#8217;ve promised to be
friends. Oh, I am <i>so</i> glad for you, Bob.&#8221;</p>
<p>He swallowed a lump in his throat and nodded. &#8220;Yes,
I&#8217;ll understand, June. It&mdash;it was awful nice of you to
tell me. I reckon you ought to hate me, the way I
treated you. Most girls would.&#8221;</p>
<p>She flashed a quick look at his flaming face. His embarrassment
relieved hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;As if <i>you</i> knew what most girls would think,&#8221; she
derided. Nevertheless she shifted the conversation to
grounds less personal and dangerous. &#8220;Now you can
tell me some more about that Dud you&#8217;re always braggin&#8217;
of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob did not know as he talked of his friend that June
found what he said an interpretation of Robert Dillon
rather than Dudley Hollister.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
<h3>A RESPONSIBLE CITIZEN</h3>
</div>

<p>Dillon and Hollister were lounging on the bank of Elk
Creek through the heat of the day. They had been
chasing a jack-rabbit across the mesa for sport. Their
broncos were now grazing close at hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever notice how a jack-rabbit jumps high when it&#8217;s
crowded?&#8221; Dud asked idly.</p>
<p>Bob nodded. &#8220;Like a deer. Crowd one an&#8217; he gets to
jumpin&#8217; high. &#8217;D you see that jack turn a somersault
just as I threw my rope the last time?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dud&#8217;s keen eyes ranged the landscape. They were on
the edge of the mesa where it dipped down into the valley.
Since he and Bob had decided to preëmpt a quarter-section
each, it had become a habit of his to study the
localities over which they rode.</p>
<p>&#8220;Country looks good round here,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed his friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we lookin&#8217; for anyhow, Bob?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wood, grass, and water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;re right here, ain&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob had been thinking the same thing himself. They
saddled and quartered over the ground carefully. There
was a wide stretch of meadow close to the junction of
Elk Creek and the river. Upon part of it a growth of
young willow had sprung up. But he judged that there
was nearly one hundred and fifty acres of prairie. This
would need no clearing. Rich wild grass already covered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
it luxuriously. For their first crop they could cut the
native hay. Then they could sow timothy. There would
be no need to plough the meadow. The seed could be
disked in. Probably the land never would need ploughing,
for it was a soft black loam.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about roads?&#8221; Bob asked. &#8220;The old-timers
claim we&#8217;ll never get roads here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one&#8217;s going to take up all this river land
mighty soon. That&#8217;s a cinch. An&#8217; the roads will come
right soon after the settlers. Fact is, we&#8217;ve got to jump
if we&#8217;re going to take up land on the river an&#8217; get a
choice location.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My notion too,&#8221; agreed Bob. &#8220;We&#8217;d better get a
surveyor out here this week.&#8221;</p>
<p>They did. Inside of a month they had filed papers at
the land office, built cabins, and moved their few possessions
to the claims. Their houses were made of logs
mud-chinked, with dirt floors and shake roofs instead of
the usual flat dirt ones. They expected later to whipsaw
lumber for the floors. A huge fireplace in one end of
each cabin was used for cooking as well as for heat until
such time as they could get stoves. Already they
planned a garden, and in the evenings were as likely to
talk of turnips, beets, peas, beans, and potatoes as of the
new Hereford bulls Larson and Harshaw were importing
from Denver.</p>
<p>For the handwriting was on the wall. Cattlemen must
breed up or go out of business. The old dogy would not
do any longer. Already Utah stock was displacing the
poor southern longhorns. Soon these, too, would belong
to the past. Dud and Bob had vision enough to see this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
and they were making plans to get a near-pedigreed
bull.</p>
<p>Dud sighed in reminiscent appreciation of the old
days that were vanishing. He might have been seventy-two
instead of twenty-two coming February. Behind
him lay apparently all his golden youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got to adopt ourselves to new ways, old Sure-Shot,&#8221;
he ruminated aloud. &#8220;Got to quit hellin&#8217; around
an&#8217; raisin&#8217; Cain. Leastways I have. You never did do
any o&#8217; that. Yes, sir, I got to be a responsible citizen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The partner of the responsible citizen leaned back in
a reclining chair which he had made from a plank sawed
into five parts that were nailed together at angles.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be raisin&#8217; little towheads right soon,&#8221; he said
through a cloud of smoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. Not me. Not Dud Hollister. I can boss
my own se&#8217;f for a spell yet,&#8221; the fair-haired youth protested
vehemently. &#8220;When I said we got to adopt ourselves,
I was thinkin&#8217; of barb-wire fences an&#8217; timothy
hay. &#8217;S all right to let the dogies rough through the
winter an&#8217; hunt the gulches when the storms come. But
it won&#8217;t do with stock that&#8217;s bred up. Harshaw lost
close to forty per cent of his cattle three years ago. It
sure put some crimp in him. He was hit hard again last
winter. You know that. Say he&#8217;d had valuable stock.
Why, it would put him outa business. Sure would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted Bob. &#8220;There&#8217;s a schoolmarm down
at Meeker was askin&#8217; me about you. You know her&mdash;that
snappin&#8217;-eyed brunette. Wanted to know all about
yore claim, an&#8217; was it a good one, an&#8217; didn&#8217;t I think Mr.
Hollister a perfect gentleman, an&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>Dud snatched a blanket from the bunk and smothered
the red head. They clinched, rolled on the floor,
and kicked over the chair and stool. Presently they
emerged from battle feeling happier.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we got to feed. Tha&#8217;s the new law an&#8217; the gospel
of the range,&#8221; Dud continued. &#8220;Got to keep our
cattle under fence in winter an&#8217; look after &#8217;em right.
Cattle-raisin&#8217; as a gamble will be a losing bet right soon.
It&#8217;s a business now. Am I right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds reasonable to me, Dud.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s face was grave, but he smiled inwardly. The
doctrine that his friend had just been expounding was
not new to him. He had urged it on Dud during many a
ride and at more than one night camp, had pointed to
the examples of Larson, Harshaw, and the other old-timers.
Hollister was a happy-go-lucky youth. The
old hard-riding cattle days suited him better. But he,
too, had been forced at last to see the logic of the situation.
Now, with all the ardor of a convert, he was urging
his view on a partner who did not need to be convinced.</p>
<p>Dillon knew that stock-raising was entering upon a
new phase, that the old loose range system must give
way to better care, attention to breeding, and close
business judgment. The cattleman who stuck to the old
ways would not survive.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>
<h3>BEAR CAT ASLEEP</h3>
</div>

<p>Bear Cat basked in the mellow warmth of Indian summer.
Peace brooded over the valley, a slumberous and
placid drowsiness. Outside Platt &amp; Fortner&#8217;s store big
freight wagons stood close to the sidewalk. They had
just come in from their long overland journey and had
not yet been unloaded. A Concord stage went its dusty
way down the street headed for Newcastle. Otherwise
there was little evidence of activity.</p>
<p>It was about ten o&#8217;clock in the morning. The saloons
and gambling-houses were almost deserted. The brisk
business of the night had died down. Even a poker
player and a faro dealer must sleep.</p>
<p>Main Street was in a coma. A dog lazily poked a
none too inquisitive nose into its epidermis in a languid
search for fleas. Past the dog went a barefoot urchin
into a store for two pounds of eight-penny nails.</p>
<p>Three horsemen appeared at the end of the street and
moved down it at the jog-trot which is the road gait of
the cowpuncher. They dismounted near the back door
of Platt &amp; Fortner&#8217;s and flung the bridle reins over the
wheel spokes of the big freight wagons with the high
sides. They did not tie the reins even in slip knots.</p>
<p>The riders stood for a moment talking in low voices
before they separated. One went into Dolan&#8217;s. He was
a good-looking young fellow about twenty. A second
wandered into the hotel saloon. He was not good-looking
and was twice twenty. The third strolled past the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
bank, glanced in, turned, and walked past it a second
time. He straddled, with jingling spurs, into the big
store.</p>
<p>Tom Platt nodded casually to him. &#8220;Anything I can
do for you, Houck?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon,&#8221; Houck grunted.</p>
<p>Platt noticed that he limped slightly. He had no feeling
of friendliness toward Houck, but common civility
made him inquire how the wounded leg was doing.
After the Indian campaign the Brown&#8217;s Park man had
gone to Meeker for his convalescence. That had been
two months since.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;S all right,&#8221; growled the big fellow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. Thought you kinda favored it a little when
you walked.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Brown&#8217;s Park man bought a plug of chewing tobacco
and a shirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess the soldiers got the Utes corralled all right by
this time. Hear anything new about that?&#8221; Platt asked
by way of making conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Houck replied shortly. &#8220;Got an empty gunnysack
I could have?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221; The storekeeper found one and a string with
which to tie it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take a slab of side meat an&#8217; a pound of ground
coffee,&#8221; the big man growled.</p>
<p>He made other purchases,&mdash;flour, corn meal, beans,
and canned tomatoes. These he put in the gunnysack,
tying the open end. Out of the side door he went to the
horses standing by the big freight wagons. The contents
of the sack he transferred to saddle-bags.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>Then, without any apparent doubt as to what he was
going to do next, he dropped into another store, one
which specialized in guns and ammunition, though it,
too, sold general supplies. He bought cartridges, both
for the two forty-fives and for the rifle he carried. These
he actually tested in his weapons, to make sure they
fitted easily.</p>
<p>The proprietor attempted a pleasantry. &#8220;You&#8217;re
kinda garnished with weapons, stranger. Not aimin&#8217; to
hold up the town, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The amiable laugh died away. The wall-eyed stranger
was looking at him in bleak silence. Not an especially
timid man, the owner of the place felt a chill run down
his spine. That stare carried defiance, an unvoiced
threat. Later, the storekeeper made of it a stock part of
his story of the day&#8217;s events.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the stranger gave me that look of his I knew
right away something was doing. &#8217;Course I didn&#8217;t know
what. I&#8217;ll not claim I did, but I was sure there&#8217;d be a
job for the coroner before night. Blister come into the
store just after he left. I said to him, &#8216;Who&#8217;s that big
black guy?&#8217; He says, &#8216;Jake Houck.&#8217; &#8216;Well,&#8217; I says,
&#8216;Jake Houck is sure up to some deviltry.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>It is easy to be a prophet after the event. When
Houck jingled out of the store and along the sidewalk to
the hotel, none of the peaceful citizens he met guessed
what he had in mind. None of them saw the signal
which passed between him and the young fellow who
had just come out of Dolan&#8217;s. This was not a gesture.
No words were spoken, but a message went from one to
the other and back. The young puncher disappeared
again into Dolan&#8217;s.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>Afterward, when Bear Cat began to assemble its recollections
of the events prior to the dramatic climax, it
was surprising how little that was authentic could be
recalled. Probably a score of people noted casually the
three strangers. Houck was recognized by three or four,
Bandy Walker by at least one. The six-foot youngster
with them was known by nobody who saw him. It was
learned later that he had never been in the town before.
The accounts of how the three spent the hour between
ten and eleven are confusing. If they met during that
time it was only for a moment or two while passing. But
it is certain that Bandy Walker could not have been both
in the blacksmith shop and at Platt &amp; Fortner&#8217;s five
minutes before eleven. The chances are that some of the
town people, anxious to have even a small part in the
drama, mixed in their minds these strangers with others
who had ridden in.</p>
<p>Bob Dillon and Dud Hollister dropped from their saddles
in front of the hotel at just eleven o&#8217;clock. They
had ridden thirty miles and stood for a moment stretching
the cramp out of their muscles.</p>
<p>Dud spoke, nodding his head to the right. &#8220;Look
what&#8217;s here, Sure-Shot. Yore friend Bandy&mdash;old, tried,
an&#8217; true.&#8221;</p>
<p>Walker was trailing his high-heeled boots through the
dust across the street from Dolan&#8217;s toward the big store.
If he saw Bob he gave no sign of knowing him.</p>
<p>The two friends passed into the hotel. They performed
the usual rites of internal and external ablutions.
They returned to the bar, hooked their heels, and
swapped with Mike the news of the day.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hear Larson&#8217;s bought the K T brand. Anything to
it?&#8221; asked Dud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paid seven thousand down, time on the balance,&#8221;
Mike said. &#8220;How you lads makin&#8217; it on Elk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine. We got the best preëmptions on the river.
Plenty of good grass, wood an&#8217; water handy, a first-class
summer range. It&#8217;s an A1 layout, looks like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of nowhere, I reckon,&#8221; Mike grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best steers are on the edge of the herd,&#8221; Dud retorted
cheerfully. &#8220;It&#8217;s that way with ranches too. A fellow
couldn&#8217;t raise much of a herd in Denver, could he?&#8221;</p>
<p>A sound like the explosion of a distant firecracker
reached them. It was followed by a second.</p>
<p>It is strange what a difference there is between the report
of one shot and another. A riotous cowpuncher
bangs away into the air to stress the fact that he is a live
one on the howl. Nobody pays the least attention. A
bullet flies from a revolver barrel winged with death.
Men at the roulette wheel straighten up to listen. The
poker game is automatically suspended, a hand half
dealt. By some kind of telepathy the players know that
explosion carries deadly menace.</p>
<p>So now the conversation died. No other sound came,
but the two cattlemen and the bartender were keyed to
tense alertness. They had sloughed instantly the easy
indolence of casual talk.</p>
<p>There came the slap of running footsteps on the sidewalk.
A voice called in excitement, &#8220;They&#8217;ve killed
Ferril.&#8221;</p>
<p>The eyes of the Elk Creek ranchers met. They knew
now what was taking place. Ferril was cashier of the
Bear Cat bank.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>
<h3>BEAR CAT AWAKE</h3>
</div>

<p>At exactly eleven o&#8217;clock Houck, Bandy Walker, and
the big young cowpuncher who had ridden into town
with them met at the corner of one of the freight wagons.
Houck talked, the others listened, except for a
comment or two. A cattleman passing them on his way
to the bank recalled afterward that the low voice of the
Brown&#8217;s Park man was deadly serious.</p>
<p>The two big men walked into the bank. Bandy
stayed with the horses. In the building, not counting
the cashier and his assistant, were two or three patrons
of the institution. One was Sturgis, a round little man
who had recently started a drug-store in Bear Cat. He
was talking to the assistant cashier. The cattleman was
arranging with Ferril for a loan.</p>
<p>The attention of the cattleman drifted from the business
in hand. &#8220;Carryin&#8217; a good deal of hardware, ain&#8217;t
they, Gus?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ferril smiled. &#8220;Most of the boys are quittin&#8217; that
foolishness, but some of &#8217;em can&#8217;t get it out of their
heads that they look big when they&#8217;re gun-toters. Kind
of a kid business, looks to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The eyes of the cattleman rested on Houck. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t call that big black fellow a kid. Who is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know. Reckon we&#8217;re due to find out. He&#8217;s
breakin&#8217; away from the other fellow and movin&#8217; this
way.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>Houck observed that the big cowpuncher was nervous.
The hand hitched in the sagging belt was trembling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t weaken, Dave,&#8221; he said in a whisper out of
the corner of his mouth. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be outa town in ten
minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; agreed the other in a hoarse murmur.</p>
<p>Houck sauntered to the cage. This was a recent importation
from Denver. Bear Cat was proud of it as
an evidence of progress. It gave the bank quite a metropolitan
air.</p>
<p>He stood behind the cattleman, the wall at his back so
that his broad shoulders brushed it. Jake had no intention
of letting any one get in his rear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stick yore hands up!&#8221; he ordered roughly.</p>
<p>The cattleman did not turn. His hands went up instantly.
A half a second later those of the startled
cashier lifted toward the ceiling.</p>
<p>The assistant made a bad mistake. He dived for the
revolver in the desk close at hand.</p>
<p>Houck fired. The bank clerk dropped.</p>
<p>That shot sent panic through the heart of Sturgis. He
bolted for the side door. A second shot from Houck&#8217;s
weapon did not stop him. A moment more, and he was
on the street racing to spread the alarm.</p>
<p>The leader of the bank robbers swung round on Ferril.
His voice was harsh, menacing. He knew that every
moment now counted. From under his coat he had
drawn a gunnysack.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bank money&mdash;quick. No silver&mdash;gold an&#8217;
any bills you&#8217;ve got.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>Ferril opened the safe. He stuffed into the sack both
loose and packed gold. He had a few bills, not many,
for in the West paper money was then used very little.</p>
<p>&#8220;No monkey business,&#8221; snarled Houck after he had
stood up against the opposite wall the cattleman and
the depositor who chanced to be in the bank. &#8220;This all
you got? Speak up, or I&#8217;ll drill you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cashier hesitated, but the ominous hollow eye
into which he looked was persuasive. He opened an
inner compartment lined with bags of gold. These he
thrust into the gunnysack.</p>
<p>The robber named Dave tied with shaking fingers the
loose end of the sack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time to go,&#8221; announced Houck grimly. &#8220;You&#8217;re
goin&#8217; with us far as our horses&mdash;all of you. We ain&#8217;t
lookin&#8217; for to be bushwhacked.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lined up the bodyguard in front and on each side
of himself and his accomplice. Against the back of the
cattleman he pushed the end of the revolver barrel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lead the way,&#8221; he ordered with an oath.</p>
<p>Houck had heard the sound of running feet along the
street. He knew it was more than likely that there
would be a fight before he and his men got out of town.
This was not in his reckoning. The shots fired inside the
bank had been outside his calculations. They had been
made necessary only by the action of the teller. Jake&#8217;s
plan had been to do the job swiftly and silently, to get
out of town before word of what had taken place reached
the citizens. He had chosen Bear Cat as the scene of the
robbery because there was always plenty of money in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
the bank, because he owed its people a grudge, and because
it was so far from a railroad.</p>
<p>As he had outlined the hold-up to his fellows in crime,
it had looked like a moderately safe enterprise. But he
realized now that he had probably led them into a trap.
Nearly every man in Bear Cat was a big-game hunter.
This meant that they were dead shots.</p>
<p>Houck knew that it would be a near thing if his party
got away in time. A less resolute man would have
dropped the whole thing after the alarm had been given
and ridden away at once. But he was no quitter. So he
was seeing it out.</p>
<p>The cattleman led the procession through the side
door into the street.</p>
<p>Sunshine warm and mellow still bathed the street,
just as it had done ten minutes earlier. But there was a
difference. Dave felt a shiver run down his spine.</p>
<p>From the horses Bandy barked a warning. &#8220;Hurry,
Jake, for God&#8217;s sake. They&#8217;re all round us.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL</h2>
<h3>BIG-GAME HUNTERS AT WORK</h3>
</div>

<p>Bob and his partner did not rush out of the hotel instantly
to get into the fray. They did what a score of
other able-bodied men of Bear Cat were doing&mdash;went
in search of adequate weapons with which to oppose the
bank robbers. Bear Cat was probably the best-equipped
town in the country to meet a sudden emergency of this
kind. In every house, behind the door or hanging on the
wall, was a rifle used to kill big game. In every house
was at least one man who knew how to handle that rifle.
All he had to do was to pick up the weapon, load it, and
step into the street.</p>
<p>June was in the kitchen with Chung Lung. The
Reverend Melancthon Browning had just collected two
dollars from Chung for the foreign missionary fund.
Usually the cook was a cheerful giver, but this morning
he was grumbling a little. He had been a loser at hop
toy the night before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mister Blowning he keep busy asking for dollars.
He tell me givee to the Lord. Gleat smoke, Lord allee
timee bloke?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl laughed. The Oriental&#8217;s quaint irreverence
was of the letter and not of the spirit.</p>
<p>Through the swing door burst Bob Dillon. &#8220;Know
where there&#8217;s a rifle, June?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him, big-eyed. &#8220;Not the Utes again?&#8221;
she gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bank robbers. I want a gun.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>Without a word she turned and led him swiftly down
the passage to a bedroom. In one corner of it was a
.40-.70 Marlin. From a peg above hung a cartridge
belt. Bob loaded the gun.</p>
<p>June&#8217;s heart beat fast. &#8220;You&#8217;ll&mdash;be careful?&#8221; she
cautioned.</p>
<p>He nodded as he ran out of the door and into the alley
behind.</p>
<p>Platt &amp; Fortner&#8217;s was erecting a brick store building,
the first of its kind in Bear Cat. The walls were up
to the second story and the window frames were in.
Through the litter of rubbish left by the workmen Bob
picked a hurried way to one of the window spaces. Two
men were crouched in another of these openings not fifteen
feet from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many of &#8217;em?&#8221; he asked in a loud whisper.</p>
<p>Blister answered from the embrasure opposite.
&#8220;D-don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still in the bank, are they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some one peered out of Dolan&#8217;s through the crack of
a partly opened door. Bob caught the gleam of the sun
upon the barrel of a gun. A hat with a pair of eyes beneath
the rim of it showed above the sill of a window in
the blacksmith shop opposite. Bear Cat was all set for
action.</p>
<p>A man was standing beside some horses near the back
door of Platt &amp; Fortner&#8217;s. He was partially screened
from Bob&#8217;s view by one of the broncos and by a freight
wagon, but the young cattleman had a fleeting impression
that he was Bandy Walker. Was he, too, waiting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
to get a shot at the bandits? Probably so. He had a
rifle in his hands. But it struck Dillon he was taking
chances. When the robbers came out of the bank they
would be within thirty feet of him.</p>
<p>Out of the front door of the bank a little group of men
filed. Two of them were armed. The others flanked
them on every side. Ferril the cashier carried a gunnysack
heavily loaded.</p>
<p>A man stepped out upon the platform in front of
Platt &amp; Fortner&#8217;s. From his position he looked down
on the little bunch of men moving toward the horses.
Bandy Walker, beside the horses, called on Houck to
hurry, that they were being surrounded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got you covered. Throw down yore guns,&#8221; the
man on the platform shouted to the outlaws, rifle at
shoulder.</p>
<p>Houck&#8217;s revolver flashed into the air. He fired across
the shoulder of the man whom he was using as a screen.
The rifleman on the store porch sat down suddenly, his
weapon clattering to the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another of &#8217;em,&#8221; Houck said aloud with a savage
oath. &#8220;Any one else lookin&#8217; for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Walker moved forward with the horses. Afraid that
general firing would begin at any moment, Ferril
dropped the sack and ran for the shelter of the wagons.
His flight was a signal for the others who had been marshaled
out of the bank. They scattered in a rush for
cover.</p>
<p>Instantly Houck guessed what would follow. From
every side a volley of bullets would be concentrated on
him and his men. He too ran, dodging back into the
bank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>He was not a tenth part of a second too soon. A fusillade
of shots poured down. It seemed that men were
firing from every door, window, and street corner.
Bandy Walker fell as he started to run. Two bullets tore
through his heart, one from each side. The big cowpuncher
never stirred from his tracks. He went down at
the first volley. Five wounds, any one of which would
have been mortal, were later found in his body and head.</p>
<p>All told, the firing had not lasted as long as it would
take a man to run across a street. Bear Cat had functioned.
The bank robbers were out of business.</p>
<p>The news spread quicker than the tongue could tell
it. From all directions men, women, and children converged
toward the bank. In the excitement the leader of
the bandits was forgotten for a minute or two.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the third fellow?&#8221; a voice asked.</p>
<p>The question came from Dud Hollister. He had
reached the scene too late to take any part in the battle,
much to his chagrin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Went into the bank,&#8221; Blister said. &#8220;I s-saw him
duck in just before the shooting began.&#8221;</p>
<p>The building was surrounded and rushed. Houck was
not inside. Evidently he had run out of the back door
and made for the willows by the river. A boy claimed
that he had seen a man running in that direction.</p>
<p>A crowd of armed men beat the willows on both banks
for a distance of a mile both up and down the stream
wherever there was cover. No trace of the outlaw could
be found. Posses on horseback took up the search.
These posses not only rode up and down the river.
They scoured the mesa on the other bank all day. When
night fell Houck was still at large.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI</h2>
<h3>IN A LADY&#8217;S CHAMBER</h3>
</div>

<p>The drama of the hold-up and of the retribution that
had fallen upon the bandits had moved as swiftly as
though it had been rehearsed. There had been no
wasted words, no delay in the action. But in life the
curtain does not always drop at the right moment.
There was anticlimax in Bear Cat after the guns had
ceased to boom. In the reaction after the strain the
tongues of men and women were loosened. Relief expressed
itself in chatter. Everybody had some contributing
incident to tell.</p>
<p>Into the clatter Dud Hollister&#8217;s voice cut sharply.
&#8220;Some one get Doc Tuckerman, quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was bending over the wounded man on the platform,
trying to stop the flow of blood from a little hole
in the side.</p>
<p>Mollie stepped toward him. &#8220;Carry Art into the hotel.
I&#8217;ll have a bed ready for him time you get there.
Anybody else hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one said Ferril was shot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. He&#8217;s all right. There he is over there by the
wagons. See? Lookin&#8217; after the gold in the sack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blister came to the door of the bank in time to hear
Mollie&#8217;s question. &#8220;McCray&#8217;s been s-shot&mdash;here in
the bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring him in too,&#8221; ordered Mollie.</p>
<p>The wounded men were given first aid and carried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
into the hotel. There their wounds were dressed by the
doctor.</p>
<p>In the corridor outside Bob and his partner met June
coming out of one of the rooms where the invalids had
been taken. She was carrying a towel and some bandages.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got to get a move on me,&#8221; Dud said. &#8220;I got in after
the fireworks were over. Want to join Blister&#8217;s posse
now. You comin&#8217;, Bob?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now,&#8221; Dillon answered.</p>
<p>He was white to the lips. There was a fear in his mind
that he might be going to disgrace himself by getting
sick. The nausea had not attacked him until the shooting
was over. He was much annoyed at himself, but the
picture of the lusty outlaws lying in the dust with the
life stricken out of them had been too much.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll be hustlin&#8217; along,&#8221; Dud said, and went.</p>
<p>Bob leaned against the wall.</p>
<p>June looked at him with wise, understanding mother-eyes.
&#8220;It was kinda awful, wasn&#8217;t it? Gave me a turn
when I saw them lying there. Must have been worse for
you. Did you&mdash;hit ..?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; He was humiliated at the confession. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t fire a shot. Couldn&#8217;t, somehow. Everybody
was blazin&#8217; away at &#8217;em. That&#8217;s the kind of nerve I&#8217;ve
got,&#8221; he told her bitterly.</p>
<p>In her eyes the starlight flashed. &#8220;An&#8217; that&#8217;s the kind
I love. Oh, Bob, I wouldn&#8217;t want to think you&#8217;d killed
either of those poor men, an&#8217; one of them just a boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one had to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but not you. And they didn&#8217;t have to brag
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
afterward about it, did they? That&#8217;s horrible. Everybody
going around telling how they shot them. As if it
was something to be proud of. I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re not
in it. Let the others have the glory if they want it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He tried to be honest about it. &#8220;That&#8217;s all very well,
but they were a bad lot. They didn&#8217;t hesitate to kill.
The town had to defend itself. No, it was just that I&#8217;m
such a&mdash;baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not!&#8221; she protested indignantly. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
have you say it, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>His hungry eyes could not leave her, so slim and ardent,
all fire and flame. The sweetness of her energy, the
grace of the delicate lifted throat curve, the warmth and
color of life in her, expressed a spirit generous and fine.
His heart sang within him. Out of a world of women she
was the one he wanted, the lance-straight mate his soul
leaped out to meet.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no one like you in the world, June,&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;Nobody in all the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>She flashed at him eyes of alarm. A faint pink, such as
flushes the sea at dawn, waved into her cheeks and throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to go,&#8221; she said hurriedly. &#8220;Mollie&#8217;ll be
expectin&#8217; me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was off, light-footed as Daphne, the rhythm of
morning in her step.</p>
<p>All day she carried with her the treasure of his words
and the look that had gone with them. Did he think
it? Did he really and truly believe it? Her exaltation
stayed with her while she waited on table, while she
nursed the wounded men, while she helped Chung wash
the dishes. It went singing with her into her little bedroom
when she retired for the night.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>June sat down before the small glass and looked at the
image she saw there. What was it he liked about her?
She studied the black crisp hair, the dark eager eyes
with the dusky shadows under them in the slight hollows
beneath, the glow of red that stained the cheeks
below the pigment of the complexion. She tried looking
at the reflection from different angles to get various effects.
It was impossible for her not to know that she was
good to look at, but she had very little vanity about it.
None the less it pleased her because it pleased others.</p>
<p>She let down her long thick hair and combed it. The
tresses still had the old tendency of her childhood to
snarl unless she took good care of them. From being on
her feet all day the shoes she was wearing were uncomfortable.
She slipped them off and returned to the
brushing of the hair.</p>
<p>While craning her neck for a side view June saw in the
glass that which drained the blood from her heart. Under
the bed the fingers of a hand projected into view.
It was like her that in spite of the shock she neither
screamed nor ran to the door and cried for help. She
went on looking at her counterfeit in the glass, thoughts
racing furiously. The hand belonged to a man. She
could see that now plainly, could even make out a
section of the gauntlet on his wrist. Who was he?
What was he doing here in her room?</p>
<p>She turned in the chair, deliberately, steadying her
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better come out from there. I see you,&#8221; she said
quietly.</p>
<p>From under the bed Jake Houck crawled.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLII</h2>
<h3>A WALK IN THE PARK</h3>
</div>

<p>June was the first to speak. &#8220;So you&#8217;re here. You
didn&#8217;t get away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here,&#8221; Houck growled. &#8220;No chance for a getaway.
I ran out the back door of the bank an&#8217; ducked
into the hotel. This was the first door I come to, an&#8217; I
headed in.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was not afraid of him. The power he had once
held over her was gone forever. The girl had found resources
within herself that refused him dominance. He
was what he always had been, but she had changed. Her
vision was clearer. A game and resourceful bully he
might be, but she knew one quiet youth of a far finer
courage.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re lookin&#8217; for you along the river,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The muscles of his jaw hardened. &#8220;They&#8217;d better
hope they don&#8217;t find me, some of &#8217;em,&#8221; he bragged.</p>
<p>&#8220;So had you,&#8221; she said significantly.</p>
<p>He took her meaning instantly. The temper of Bear
Cat was on edge for a lynching. &#8220;Did they die, either o&#8217;
those fellows I shot?&#8221; the bandit demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fools, the pair of &#8217;em. If that bank teller hadn&#8217;t
grabbed for his gun we&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; got away with it fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him with disgust, not untouched with
self-scorn because she had ever let him become an overpowering
influence in her life. He could no more help
boasting than he could breathing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As it is, you&#8217;ve reached the end of your rope,&#8221; the
girl said steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think I&#8217;m at the end of a rope. I&#8217;m a
long ways from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the men with you are gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How gone? Did they get &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither of them ever moved out of his tracks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I heard the shootin&#8217; I figured it would be
thataway,&#8221; Houck said callously.</p>
<p>She could see in him no evidence whatever of regret or
remorse for what he had done. This raid, she guessed,
was of his planning. He had brought the others into it,
and they had paid the penalty of their folly. The responsibility
for their deaths lay at his door. He was not
apparently giving a thought to that.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t stay here,&#8221; she told him coldly. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
have to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go where? Can you get me a horse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; June answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got to have a horse, girl,&#8221; he wheedled. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
travel without one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care how far you travel or what becomes of
you. I want you out of here. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t want me shootin&#8217; up some o&#8217; yore
friends, would you? Well, then. If they find me here
there&#8217;ll be some funerals in Bear Cat. You can bet
heavy on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke more confidently than she felt. &#8220;They can
take care of themselves. I won&#8217;t have you here. I&#8217;ll not
protect you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The outlaw&#8217;s eyes narrowed to slits. &#8220;Throw me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
down, would you? Tell &#8217;em I&#8217;m here, mebbe?&#8221; His
face was a menace, his voice a snarl.</p>
<p>June looked at him steadily, unafraid. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t
try to bully me. It&#8217;s not worth wasting your time.&#8221;</p>
<p>To look at her was to know the truth of what she said,
but he could not help trying to dominate the girl, both
because it was his nature and because he needed so
badly her help.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! You&#8217;re not so goshalmighty. You&#8217;re jes&#8217; June
Tolliver. I&#8217;m the same Jake Houck you once promised
to marry. Don&#8217;t forget that, girl. I took you from that
white-livered fellow you married&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who saved you from the Utes when nobody else
would lift a finger for you. That comes well from you of
all men,&#8221; she flung out.</p>
<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t the point. What I&#8217;m sayin&#8217; is that I&#8217;ll
not stand for you throwin&#8217; me down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What can you do?&#8221; She stood before him in her
stockings, the heavy black hair waving down to her
hips, a slim girl whose wiry strength he could crush with
one hand.</p>
<p>Her question stopped him. What could he do if she
wanted to give him up? If he made a move toward her
she would scream, and that would bring his enemies
upon him. He could shoot her afterward, but that
would do no good. His account was heavy enough as it
stood without piling up surplusage.</p>
<p>&#8220;You aimin&#8217; for to sell me out?&#8221; he asked hoarsely.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I won&#8217;t be responsible for your death.&#8221; June
might have added another reason, a more potent one.
She knew Jake Houck, what a game and desperate villain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
he was. They could not capture him alive. It was
not likely he could be killed without one or two men at
least being shot by him. Driven into a corner, he would
fight like a wild wolf.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tha&#8217;s the way to talk, June. Help me outa this
hole. You can if you&#8217;re a mind to. Have they got patrols
out everywhere?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only on the river side of the town. They think you
escaped that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you&#8217;ll get me a horse&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not do it.&#8221; She reflected a moment, thinking
out the situation. &#8220;If you can reach the foothills you&#8217;ll
have a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>He grinned, wolfishly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll reach &#8217;em. You can
gamble on that, if I have to drop a coupla guys like I
did this mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was just the trouble. If any one interfered with
him, or even recognized him, he would shoot instantly.
He would be a deadly menace until he was out of Bear
Cat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you,&#8221; June said impulsively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go with me?&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Across the park. If they see me with you, nobody&#8217;ll
pay any attention to you. Pull your hat down over
your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did as she told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better leave your guns here. If anyone sees them&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; doing. My guns go right with me. What
are you trying to pull off?&#8221; He shot a lowering, suspicious
look at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep them under your coat, then. We don&#8217;t want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
folks looking at us too curiously. We&#8217;ll stroll along as if
we were interested in our talk. When we meet any one,
if we do, you can look down at me. That&#8217;ll hide your
face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You going with me clear to the edge of town?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Just across the square, where it&#8217;s light an&#8217;
there are liable to be people. You&#8217;ll have to look out
for yourself after that. It&#8217;s not more than two hundred
yards to the sagebrush.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready whenever you are,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>June put on her shoes and did up her hair.</p>
<p>She made him wait there while she scouted to make
sure nobody was in the corridor outside the room.</p>
<p>They passed out of the back door of the hotel.</p>
<p>Chung met them. He grunted &#8220;Glood-eveling&#8221; with
a grin at June, but he did not glance twice at her companion.</p>
<p>The two passed across a vacant lot and into the park.
They saw one or two people&mdash;a woman with a basket
of eggs, a barefoot boy returning home from after-supper
play. June carried the burden of the talk because
she was quicker-witted than Houck. Its purpose was to
deceive anybody who might happen to be looking at
them.</p>
<p>It chanced that some one <i>was</i> looking at them. He
was a young man who had been lying on the grass stargazing.
They passed close to him and he recognized
June by her walk. That was not what brought him to
his feet a moment later with a gasp of amazement. He
had recognized her companion, too, or he thought he
had. It was not credible, of course. He must be mistaken.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
And yet&mdash;if that was not Jake Houck&#8217;s straddling
slouch his eyes were playing tricks. The fellow
limped, too, just a trifle, as he had heard the Brown&#8217;s
Park man did from the effects of his wounds in the Ute
campaign.</p>
<p>But how could Houck be with June, strolling across
the park in intimate talk with her, leaning toward her
in that confidential, lover-like attitude&mdash;Jake Houck,
who had robbed the bank a few hours earlier and was
being hunted up and down the river by armed posses
ready to shoot him like a wolf? June was a good hater.
She had no use whatever for this fellow. Why, then,
would she be with him, laughing lightly and talking with
animation?</p>
<p>Bob followed them, as noiselessly as possible. And
momentarily the conviction grew in him that this was
Houck. It was puzzling, but he could not escape the
conclusion. There was a trick in the fellow&#8217;s stride, a
peculiarity of the swinging shoulders that made for identification
of the man.</p>
<p>If he could have heard the talk between them, Bob
would have better understood the situation.</p>
<p>Ever since that memorable evening when Bear Cat
had driven him away in disgrace, Houck had let loose
the worse impulses of his nature. He had gone bad, to
use the phrase of the West. Something in him had
snapped that hitherto had made him value the opinions
of men. In the old days he had been a rustler and worse,
but no crime had ever been proved against him. He
could hold his head up, and he did. But the shock to his
pride and self-esteem that night had produced in him a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
species of disintegration. He had drunk heavily and almost
constantly. It had been during the sour temper
following such a bout that he had quarreled with and
shot the Ute. From that hour his declension had been
swift. How far he had gone was shown by the way he
had taken Dillon&#8217;s great service to him. The thing
rankled in his mind, filled him with surging rage whenever
he thought of it. He hated the young fellow more
than ever.</p>
<p>But as he walked with June, slender, light-swinging,
warm with young, sensuous life, the sultry passion of
the man mounted to his brain and overpowered caution.
His vanity whispered to him. No woman saved a man
from death unless she loved him. She might give other
reasons, but that one only counted. It was easy for him
to persuade himself that she always had been fond of
him at heart. There had been moments when the quality
of her opposition to him had taken on the color of
adventure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave you at the corner,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Go back of
that house and through the barbed-wire fence. You&#8217;ll
be in the sage then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come with me to the fence,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;I got
something to tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him, sharply, coldly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got
nothing to tell me that I want to hear. I&#8217;m not doing
this for you, but to save the lives of my friends. Understand
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were for the moment in the shadow of a great
cottonwood. Houck stopped, devouring her with his
hungry eyes. Bad as the man was, he had the human
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
craving of his sex. The slim grace of her, the fundamental
courage, the lift of the oval chin, touched a chord
that went vibrating through him. He snatched her to
him, crushing his kisses upon the disturbing mouth,
upon the color spots that warmed her cheeks.</p>
<p>She was too smothered to cry out at first. Later,
she repressed the impulse. With all her strength she
fought to push him from her.</p>
<p>A step sounded, a cry, the sound of a smashing blow
going home. Houck staggered back. He reached for a
revolver.</p>
<p>June heard herself scream. A shot rang out. The
man who had rescued her crumpled up and went down.
In that horrified moment she knew he was Bob Dillon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII</h2>
<h3>NOT EVEN POWDER-BURNT</h3>
</div>

<p>Houck stood over the prostrate man, the smoking revolver
in his hand, on his lips a cruel twist and in his
throat a wolfish snarl.</p>
<p>June, watching him with eyes held in a fascination of
terror, felt that at any moment he might begin pumping
shots into the supine body. She shook off the palsy
that held her and almost hurled her soft young body at
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; she begged. &#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; Cold fingers
clutched at his wrist, dragged down the barrel of the
forty-five.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had it comin&#8217;. He was askin&#8217; for it,&#8221; the outlaw
said. He spoke huskily, still looking down at the crumpled
figure.</p>
<p>The girl felt in him the slackness of indecision.
Should he shoot again and make sure? Or let the thing
go as it was? In an instant he would have made up his
mind.</p>
<p>She spoke quickly, words tumbling out pell-mell.
&#8220;You must hurry&mdash;hurry! When they heard that
shot&mdash;Listen! There&#8217;s some one coming. Oh, run,
run!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her staccato warning deflected his mind from the
course toward which it might have turned. He held up
his head, listening. The slap of footsteps on a board
walk could be plainly heard. A voice lifted itself in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
question into the night. The door of Dolan&#8217;s opened
and let out a fan-shaped shaft of light. The figures of
men could be seen as they surged across the lit space
into the darkness. June had spoken the truth. He must
hurry if he was to escape. To shoot again now would be
to advertise the spot where he was.</p>
<p>He wrenched his arm from her fingers and ran. He
moved as awkwardly as a bear, but he covered ground
swiftly. In a few seconds the night had swallowed him.</p>
<p>Instantly the girl was beside Dillon, on her knees,
lifting his head into her arms. &#8220;Oh, Bob&mdash;Bob!&#8221; she
wailed.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did he hit you?&#8221; she cried softly.</p>
<p>His face was puzzled. He did not yet realize what had
taken place. &#8220;Hit me&mdash;who?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That Houck. He shot you. Oh, Bob, are you much
hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dillon was recalled to a pain in his intestines. He
pressed his hand against the cartridge belt.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s here,&#8221; he said weakly.</p>
<p>He could feel the wet blood soaking through the
shirt. The thought of it almost made him lose consciousness
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;L-let&#8217;s have a look,&#8221; a squeaky voice said.</p>
<p>June looked up. Blister had arrived panting on the
scene. Larson was on his heels.</p>
<p>&#8220;We better carry him to the hotel,&#8221; the cattleman
said to the justice. &#8220;Who did it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Houck,&#8221; June sobbed. She was not weeping, but her
breath was catching.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></p>
<p>Bob tried to rise, but firm hands held him down. &#8220;I
can walk,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;Lemme try, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; insisted June.</p>
<p>Blister knelt beside Dillon. &#8220;Where&#8217;s the wound
at?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>The young fellow showed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;J-June, you go get Doc T-Tuckerman,&#8221; Blister ordered.</p>
<p>She flew to obey.</p>
<p>The fat man opened the shirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out for the blood,&#8221; Bob said, still faintly.
&#8220;Ouch!&#8221;</p>
<p>Blister&#8217;s hand was traveling slowly next to the flesh.
&#8220;N-no blood here,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I felt it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;R-reckon not, son.&#8221; Blister exposed his hand in the
moonlight.</p>
<p>The evidence bore out what he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s bleeding internally,&#8221; Bob said.</p>
<p>Larson had picked up the belt they had unstrapped
from Dillon&#8217;s waist. He was examining it closely. His
keen eyes found a dent in the buckle. The buckle had
been just above the spot where Bob complained of the
pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it ain&#8217;t,&#8221; Larson said. &#8220;Looks like he hit
yore belt an&#8217; the bullet went flyin&#8217; wild.&#8221;</p>
<p>A closer examination showed that this must be what
had taken place. There was no wound on Bob&#8217;s body.
He had been stunned by the shock and his active imagination
had at once accepted the assumption that he had
been wounded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></p>
<p>Bob rose with a shamefaced laugh. The incident
seemed to him very characteristic. He was always making
a fool of himself by getting frightened when there
was no need of it. One could not imagine Dud Hollister
lying down and talking faintly about an internal bleeding
when there was not a scratch on his body, nor fancying
that he could feel blood soaking through his shirt
because somebody had shot at him.</p>
<p>As the three men walked back toward the hotel, they
met June and Dud. The girl cried out at sight of
Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a false alarm,&#8221; he told her bitterly. &#8220;He
didn&#8217;t hit me a-tall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hit his b-belt buckle. If this here T-Texas man
lives to be a hundred he&#8217;ll never have a closer call.
Think of a fellow whangin&#8217; away with a forty-five
right close to him, hitting him where he was aimin&#8217; for,
and not even scratching Bob. O&#8217; course the shock of it
knocked him cold. Naturally it would. But I&#8217;ll go on
record that our friend here was born lucky. I&#8217;d ought
by rights to be holdin&#8217; an inquest on the remains,&#8221;
Blister burbled cheerfully.</p>
<p>June said nothing. She drew a long sigh of relief and
looked at Bob to make sure that they were concealing
nothing from her.</p>
<p>He met her look in a kind of dogged despair. On this
one subject he was so sensitive that he found criticisms
where none were intended. Blister was making excuses
for him, he felt, was preparing a way of escape from his
chicken-hearted weakness. And he did not want the
failure palliated.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of all that explainin&#8217;, Blister?&#8221; he
said bluntly. &#8220;Fact is, I got scared an&#8217; quit cold.
Thought I was shot up when I wasn&#8217;t even powder-burnt.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned on his heel and walked away.</p>
<p>Dud&#8217;s white teeth showed in his friendly, affectionate
grin. &#8220;Never did see such a fellow for backin&#8217; hisself
into a corner an&#8217; allowin&#8217; that he&#8217;s a plumb quitter.
I&#8217;ll bet, if the facts were known, he come through all
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>June decided to tell her story. &#8220;Yes, Dud. He must
have seen Jake Houck with me, and when Jake&mdash;annoyed
me&mdash;Bob jumped at him and hit him. Then
Jake shot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucky he didn&#8217;t shoot again after Bob was down,&#8221;
ventured Dud on a search for information.</p>
<p>In the darkness none of them could see the warm glow
that swept across the cheeks of the girl. &#8220;I kinda got in
his way&mdash;and told him he&#8217;d better hurry,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but&mdash;Where did you meet Houck? How did
he happen to be with you?&#8221; asked Larson. &#8220;To be
on this side of town he must &#8217;a&#8217; slipped through the
guards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He never went to the river. I found him under the
bed in my room a few minutes ago. Said he ran in there
after he left the bank. He wanted me to get him a horse.
I wouldn&#8217;t. But I knew if he was found cornered he
would kill somebody before he was taken. Maybe two
or three. I didn&#8217;t know. And of course he wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217;
let me leave the room alone anyhow. So I said I&#8217;d walk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
across the park with him and let him slip into the sage.
I thought it would be better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dud nodded. &#8220;We&#8217;d better get the boys on his trail
immediate.&#8221;</p>
<p>They separated, with that end in view.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIV</h2>
<h3>BOB HOLDS HIS RED HAID HIGH</h3>
</div>

<p>At the corner of the street Bob came upon Tom Reeves
and an old Leadville miner in argument. Tom made
the high sign to Dillon.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all the rumpus about?&#8221; he wanted to
know.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jake Houck was seen crossin&#8217; the park. He got
into the sage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! I&#8217;ll bet the hole of a doughnut he ain&#8217;t been
seen. If you was to ask me I&#8217;d say he was twenty-five
miles from here right now, an&#8217; not lettin&#8217; no grass grow
under his feet neither. I been talkin&#8217; to old wooden
head here about the railroad comin&#8217; in.&#8221; Tom&#8217;s eyes
twinkled. His friend guessed that he was trying to get a
rise out of the old-timer. &#8220;He&#8217;s sure some mossback. I
been tellin&#8217; him the railroad&#8217;s comin&#8217; through here an&#8217;
Meeker right soon, but he can&#8217;t see it. I reckon the toot
of an engine would scare him &#8217;most to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get excited about that railroad, son,&#8221; drawled
the former hard-rock driller, chewing his cud equably.
&#8220;I rode a horse to death fifteen years ago to beat the
choo-choo train in here, an&#8217; I notice it ain&#8217;t arriv yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob left them to their argument. He was not just
now in a mood for badinage. He moved up the street
past the scattered suburbs of the little frontier town.
Under the cool stars he wanted to think out what had
just taken place.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>Had he fainted from sheer fright when the gun blazed
at him? Or was Blister&#8217;s explanation a genuine one?
He had read of men being thrown down and knocked
senseless by the atmospheric shock of shells exploding
near them in battle. But this would not come in that
class. He had been actually struck. The belt buckle had
been driven against his flesh. Had this hit him with
force enough actually to drive the breath out of him?
Or had he thought himself wounded and collapsed because
of the thought?</p>
<p>It made a great deal of difference to him which of
these was true, more than it did to the little world in
which he moved. Some of the boys might guy him
good-naturedly, but nobody was likely to take the matter
seriously except himself. Bob had begun to learn
that a man ought to be his own most severe critic. He
had set out to cure himself of cowardice. He would not
be easy in mind so long as he still suspected himself of
showing the white feather.</p>
<p>He leaned on a fence and looked across the silvery
sage to a grove of quaking asp beyond. How long he
stood there, letting thoughts drift through his mind, he
did not know. A sound startled him, the faint swish of
something stirring. He turned.</p>
<p>Out of the night shadows a nymph seemed to be floating
toward him. For a moment he had a sense of unreality,
that the flow and rhythm of her movement were
born of the imagination. But almost at once he knew
that this was June in the flesh.</p>
<p>The moonlight haloed the girl, lent her the touch of
magic that transformed her from a creature not too good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
for human nature&#8217;s daily food into an ethereal daughter
of romance. Her eyes were dark pools of loveliness in a
white face.</p>
<p>&#8220;June!&#8221; he cried, excitement drumming in his blood.</p>
<p>Why had she come to find him? What impulse or purpose
had brought her out into the night in his wake?
Desire of her, tender, poignant, absorbing, pricked
through him like an ache. He wanted her. Soul and
body reached out to her, though both found expression
only in that first cry.</p>
<p>Her mouth quivered. &#8220;Oh, Bob, you silly boy! As if&mdash;as
if it matters why you were stunned. You were.
That&#8217;s enough. I&#8217;m so glad&mdash;so glad you&#8217;re not hurt.
It&#8217;s &#8217;most a miracle. He might have killed you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not tell him that he would have done it if she
had not flung her weight on his arm and dragged the
weapon down, nor how in that dreadful moment her
wits had worked to save him from the homicidal mania
of the killer.</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s heart thumped against his ribs like a caged
bird. Her dear concern was for him. It was so she construed
friendship&mdash;to give herself generously without
any mock modesty or prudery. She had come without
thought of herself because her heart had sent her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What matters is that when I called you came,&#8221; she
went on. &#8220;You weren&#8217;t afraid then, were you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t time. That&#8217;s why. I just jumped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; The expression in her soft eyes was veiled,
like autumn fires in the hills blazing through mists.
&#8220;You just jumped to help me. You forgot he carried
two forty-fives and would use them, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;I reckon if I&#8217;d thought of
that&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Even as the laughter rippled from her throat she gave
a gesture of impatience. There were times when self-depreciation
ceased to be a virtue. She remembered a
confidence Blister had once made to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;T-Texas man,&#8221; she squeaked, stuttering a little in
mimicry, &#8220;throw up that red haid an&#8217; stick out yore
chin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Up jerked the head. Bob began to grin in spite of
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose image are you m-made in?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you got over all the world?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dominion, ma&#8217;am, but not over all of it, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All of it,&#8221; she insisted, standing clean of line and
straight as a boy soldier.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right smart of it,&#8221; he compromised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every teeny bit of it,&#8221; she flung back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have yore own way. I know you will anyhow,&#8221; he
conceded.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; what are you a little lower than?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a heap lower than one angel I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stamped her foot. &#8220;You&#8217;re no such thing.
You&#8217;re as good as any one&mdash;and better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say better,&#8221; he murmured ironically.
None the less he was feeling quite cheerful again. He
enjoyed being put through his catechism by her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trouble with you is you&#8217;re so meek,&#8221; she stormed.
&#8220;You let anybody run it over you till they go too far.
What&#8217;s the use of crying your own goods down? Tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
the world you&#8217;re Bob Dillon and for it to watch your
dust.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want me to brag an&#8217; strut like Jake Houck?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No-o, not like that. But Blister&#8217;s right. You&#8217;ve
got to know your worth. When you&#8217;re sure of it you
don&#8217;t have to tell other people about it. They know.&#8221;</p>
<p>He considered this. &#8220;Tha&#8217;s correct,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob had an inspiration. It was born out of moonshine,
her urging, and the hunger of his heart. His
spurs trailed across the grass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is my red haid high enough now?&#8221; he asked, smiling.</p>
<p>Panic touched her pulse. &#8220;Yes, Bob.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What have I got over all the world?&#8221; he quizzed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dominion,&#8221; she said obediently in a small voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over all of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;don&#8217;t&mdash;know.&#8221;</p>
<p>His brown hands fastened on her shoulders. He
waited till at last her eyes came up to meet his.
&#8220;Every teeny bit of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have your own way,&#8221; she replied, trying feebly to
escape an emotional climax by repeating the words he
had used. &#8220;I know you will anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>He felt himself floating on a wave of audacious self-confidence.
&#8220;Say it, then. Every teeny bit of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every teeny bit of it,&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;That means June Tolliver too.&#8221; The look in his
eyes flooded her with love.</p>
<p>&#8220;June Dillon,&#8221; the girl corrected in a voice so soft
and low he scarcely made out the words.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></p>
<p>He caught her in his arms. &#8220;You precious lamb!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLV</h2>
<h3>THE OUTLAW GETS A BAD BREAK</h3>
</div>

<p>Houck crawled through the barbed-wire fence and
looked back into the park from which he had just fled.
June was kneeling beside the man he had shot. Some
one was running across the grass toward her. Soon the
pursuit would be at his heels. He dared not lose a
second.</p>
<p>He plunged into the sage, making for the hills which
rose like a saw-toothed wall on the horizon. If he could
reach them he might find there a precarious safety.
Some wooded pocket would give him shelter until the
pursuit had swept past. He was hungry, but if he must
he could do without food for a day.</p>
<p>The bandit was filled with a furious, impotent rage at
the way fortune had tricked him. Thirty-five miles from
Bear Cat, well back from the river, three horses were
waiting for him and his dead companions in a draw.
Unless somebody found them they would wait a long
time. The way that led to them was barred for him. He
would have to try to reach Glenwood or Rifle. From
there he could perhaps catch a freight east or west. His
one chance was to get clear out of the country. After
this day&#8217;s work it would be too small to hold him.</p>
<p>Nothing had come out as he had planned it. The
farthest thing from his hopes had been that he would
have to fight his way out. He had not killed that fool
Dillon of set purpose. He knew now that if his anger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
had not blazed out he might have made his getaway and
left the fellow alive. But he had been given no time to
think. It was a bad break of the luck. The White River
settlers would not forgive him that. They would remember
that Dillon had saved him from the Indians in
the Ute campaign, and they would reason&mdash;the thickheaded
idiots&mdash;that the least he could have done was
to let the boy go.</p>
<p>He plunged through the sand of the sage hills at a
gait that was half a run and half a walk. In his high-heeled
boots fast travel was difficult. The footgear of
the cattleman is not made for walking. The hill riders
do most of their travel in a saddle. Houck&#8217;s feet hurt.
His toes were driven forward in the boots until each step
became torture. From his heels the skin peeled from
sliding up and down against the hard leather.</p>
<p>But he dared not stop. Already he could hear the
pursuers. In the still night there came to him the shout
of one calling to another, the ring of a horse&#8217;s hoof
striking on a stone. They were combing the mesa
behind him.</p>
<p>Houck stumbled forward. Vaguely there rose before
him a boulder-strewn slope that marked the limit of the
valley. Up this he scrambled in a desperate hurry to
reach the rocks. For the pursuit was almost upon him
now.</p>
<p>Two outcroppings of sandstone barred the way.
They leaned against each other, leaving a small cave
beneath. Into this Houck crawled on hands and knees.</p>
<p>He lay crouched there, weapon in hand, like a cornered
wolf, while the riders swept up and past. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
knew one palpitating moment when he thought himself
about to be discovered. Two of the posse stopped close
to his hiding-place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must be close to him,&#8221; one said. &#8220;Got the makin&#8217;s,
Jim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221; Evidently the tobacco pouch was passed
from one to the other. &#8220;Right in these rocks somewhere,
I shouldn&#8217;t wonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbeso. Mebbe still hot-footin&#8217; it for the hills.
He&#8217;s in one heluva hurry if you ask me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Killed Bob Dillon in the park, I heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he did he&#8217;ll sure hang for it, after what Dillon did
for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>There came the faint sound of creaking leather as
their horses moved up the hill.</p>
<p>The outlaw waited till they were out of hearing before
he crept into the open. Across the face of the slope he
cut obliquely, working always toward higher ground.
His lips were drawn back so that the tobacco-stained
teeth showed in a snarl of savage rage. It would go ill
with any of the posse if they should stumble on him.
He would have no more mercy than a hunted wild
beast.</p>
<p>With every minute now his chances of safety increased.
The riders were far above him and to the left.
With luck he should reach Piceance Creek by morning.
He would travel up it till he came to Pete Tolliver&#8217;s
place. He would make the old man give him a horse.
Not since the night he had been ridden out of Bear
Cat on a rail had he seen the nester. But Pete always
had been putty in his hands. It would be easy enough to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
bully him into letting him have whatever he wanted.
All he needed was a saddled mount and provisions.</p>
<p>Houck was on unfamiliar ground. If there were settlers
in these hills he did not know where they were.
Across the divide somewhere ran Piceance Creek, but except
in a vague way he was not sure of the direction it
took. It was possible he might lay hold of a horse this
side of Tolliver&#8217;s. If so, he would not for a moment hesitate
to take it.</p>
<p>All night he traveled. Once he thought he heard a
distant dog, but though he moved in the direction from
which the barking had come he did not find any ranch.
The first faint glimmer of gray dawn had begun to
lighten the sky when he reached the watershed of Piceance.</p>
<p>It had been seventeen hours since he had tasted
water and that had been as a chaser after a large drink
of whiskey. He was thirsty, and he hastened his pace to
reach the creek. Moving down the slope, he pulled up
abruptly. He had run into a cavvy grazing on the hill.</p>
<p>A thick growth of pine and piñon ran up to the ridge
above. Back of a scrub evergreen Houck dropped to
consider a plan of action. He meant to get one of these
horses, and to do this he must have it and be gone before
dawn. This was probably some round-up. If he could
drift around close to the camp and find a saddle, there
would likely be a rope attached to it. He might, of
course, be seen, but he would have to take a chance on
that.</p>
<p>Chance befriended him to his undoing. As he crept
through the brush something caught his ankle and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
stumbled. His groping fingers found a rope. One end of
the rope was attached to a stake driven into the ground.
The other led to a horse, a pinto, built for spirit and for
speed, his trained eye could tell.</p>
<p>He pulled up the stake and wound up the rope, moving
toward the pinto as he did so. He decided it would
be better not to try to get a saddle till he reached Tolliver&#8217;s
place. The rope would do for a bridle at a pinch.</p>
<p>The horse backed away from him, frightened at this
stranger who had appeared from nowhere. He followed,
trying in a whisper to soothe the animal. It backed into
a small piñon, snapping dry branches with its weight.</p>
<p>Houck cursed softly. He did not want to arouse anybody
in the camp or to call the attention of the night
jinglers to his presence. He tried to lead the pinto away,
but it balked and dug its forefeet into the ground, leaning
back on the rope.</p>
<p>The outlaw murmured encouragement to the horse.
Reluctantly it yielded to the steady pull on its neck.
Man and beast began to move back up the hill. As soon
as he was a safe distance from the camp, Houck meant
to make of the rope a bridle.</p>
<p>In the pre-dawn darkness he could see little and that
only as vague outlines rather than definite shapes. But
some instinct warned the hunted man that this was no
round-up camp. He did not quite know what it was.
Yet he felt as though he were on the verge of a discovery,
as though an unknown but terrible danger surrounded
him. Unimaginative he was, but something
that was almost panic flooded up in him.</p>
<p>He could not wait to mount the horse until he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
reached the brow of the hill. Drawing the rope close, he
caught at the mane of the horse and bent his knees for
the spring.</p>
<p>Houck had an instant&#8217;s warning, and his revolver was
half out of its scabbard when the rush of the attack flung
him against the startled animal. He fought like a baited
bear, exerting all his great strength to fling back the figures
that surged up at him out of the darkness. From
all sides they came at him, with guttural throat cries,
swarming over each other as he beat them down.</p>
<p>The struggling mass quartered over the ground like
some unwieldy prehistoric reptile. Houck knew that if
he lost his footing he was done for. Once, as the cluster
of fighters swung downhill, the outlaw found himself
close to the edge of the group. He got his arms free and
tried to beat off those clinging to him. Out of the mêlée
he staggered, a pair of arms locked tightly round his
thighs. Before he could free himself another body flung
itself at his shoulder and hurled him from his feet.</p>
<p>His foes piled on him as ants do on a captured insect.
His arms were tied behind him with rawhide thongs, his
feet fastened together rather loosely.</p>
<p>He was pulled to a sitting posture. In the east the sky
had lightened with the promise of the coming day.</p>
<p>His clothes torn from arms and body, his face bleeding
from random blows, Houck looked round on the
circle of his captors defiantly. In his glaring eyes and
close-clamped, salient jaw no evidence was written of
the despair that swept over him in a wave and drowned
hope. He had in this bleak hour of reckoning the virtue
of indomitable gameness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right. You got me. Go to it, you red devils,&#8221; he
growled.</p>
<p>The Utes gloated over him in a silence more deadly
than any verbal threats. Their enemy had been delivered
into their hands.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVI</h2>
<h3>THE END OF A CROOKED TRAIL</h3>
</div>

<p>In the grim faces of the Utes Houck read his doom.
He had not the least doubt of it. His trail ended here.</p>
<p>The terror in his heart rose less out of the fact itself
than the circumstances which surrounded it. The gray
dawn, the grim, copper-colored faces, the unknown torment
waiting for him, stimulated his imagination. He
could have faced his own kind, the cattlemen of the Rio
Blanco, without this clutching horror that gripped him.
They would have done what they thought necessary,
but without any unnecessary cruelty. What the Utes
would do he did not know. They would make sure
of their vengeance, but they would not be merciful
about it.</p>
<p>He repressed a shudder and showed his yellow teeth
in a grin of defiance. &#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re right glad to see
me,&#8221; he jeered.</p>
<p>Still they said nothing, only looked at their captive
with an aspect that daunted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not dumb, are you? Speak up, some of you,&#8221;
Houck snarled, fighting down the panic within him.</p>
<p>A wrinkled old Ute spoke quietly. &#8220;Man-with-loud-tongue
die. He kill Indian&mdash;give him no chance. Indians
kill him now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Houck nodded his head. &#8220;Sure I killed him. He&#8217;d
stolen my horse, hadn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>The old fellow touched his chest. &#8220;Black Arrow my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
son. You kill him. He take your horse mebbe. You
take Ute horse.&#8221; He pointed to the pinto. &#8220;Ute kill
Man-with-loud-tongue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Black Arrow reached for his gun. I had to shoot. It
was an even break.&#8221; Houck&#8217;s voice pleaded in spite of
his resolution not to weaken.</p>
<p>The spokesman for the Indians still showed an impassive
face, but his voice was scornful. &#8220;Is Man-with-loud-tongue
a yellow coyote? Does he carry the heart of
a squaw? Will he cry like a pappoose?&#8221;</p>
<p>Houck&#8217;s salient jaw jutted out. The man was a mass
of vanity. Moreover, he was game. &#8220;Who told you I
was yellow? Where did you get that? I ain&#8217;t scared of
all the damned Utes that ever came outa hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>And to prove it&mdash;perhaps, too, by way of bolstering
up his courage&mdash;he cursed the redskins with a string of
blistering oaths till he was out of breath.</p>
<p>The captive needed no explanation of the situation.
He knew that the soldiers had failed to round up and
drive back to the reservation a band of the Utes that
had split from the main body and taken to the hills. By
some unlucky chance or evil fate he had come straight
from Bear Cat to their night camp.</p>
<p>The Utes left Houck pegged out to the ground while
they sat at a little distance and held a pow-wow. The
outlaw knew they were deciding his fate. He knew them
better than to expect anything less than death. What
shook his nerve was the uncertainty as to the form it
would take. Like all frontiersmen, he had heard horrible
stories of Apache torture. In general the Utes did not
do much of that sort of thing. But they had a special
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
grudge against him. What he had done to one of them
had been at least a contributory cause of the outbreak
that had resulted so disastrously for them. He would
have to pay the debt he owed. But how? He sweated
blood while the Indians squatted before the fire and
came to a decision.</p>
<p>The council did not last long. When it broke up
Houck braced his will to face what he must. It would
not be long now. Soon he would know the worst.</p>
<p>Two of the braves went up the hill toward the cavvy.
The rest came back to their captive.</p>
<p>They stood beside him in silence. Houck scowled up
at them, still defiant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>The Utes said nothing. They stood there stolid.
Their victim read in that voiceless condemnation an
awful menace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Onload it,&#8221; he jeered. &#8220;I&#8217;m no squaw. Shoot it at
me. Jake Houck ain&#8217;t scared.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still they waited, the father of Black Arrow with
folded arms, a sultry fire burning in his dark eyes.</p>
<p>The two men who had gone to the cavvy returned.
They were leading a horse with a rope around its neck.
Houck recognized the animal with a thrill of superstitious
terror. It was the one about the possession of
which he had shot Black Arrow.</p>
<p>The old chief spoke again. &#8220;Man-with-loud-tongue
claim this horse. Utes give it him. Horse his. Man-with-loud-tongue
satisfied then maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you aimin&#8217; to do, you red devils?&#8221; Houck
shouted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></p>
<p>Already he guessed vaguely at the truth. Men were
arranging a kind of harness of rope and rawhide on the
animal.</p>
<p>Others stooped to drag the captive forward. He set
his teeth to keep back the shriek of terror that rose to
his throat.</p>
<p>He knew now what form the vengeance of the savages
was to take.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVII</h2>
<h3>THE KINGDOM OF JOY</h3>
</div>

<p>A prince of the Kingdom of Joy rode the Piceance trail
on a morning glad with the song of birds and the rippling
of brooks. Knee to knee with him rode his princess, slim
and straight, the pink in her soft smooth cheeks, a shy
and eager light in the velvet-dark eyes. They were
starting together on the long, long trail, and the poor
young things could vision it only as strewn with sunbathed
columbines and goldenrods.</p>
<p>The princess was a bride, had been one for all of
twelve hours. It was her present conviction that she
lived in a world wonderful, and that the most amazingly
radiant thing in it was what had happened to her and
Bob Dillon. She pitied everybody else in the universe.
They were so blind! They looked, but they did not see
what was so clear to eyes from which the veil had been
stripped. They went about their humdrum way without
emotion. Their hearts did not sing exultant pæans
that throbbed out of them like joy-notes from a
meadow-lark&#8217;s throat. Only those who had come happily
to love&#8217;s fruition understood the meaning of life.
June was not only happy; she was this morning wise,
heiress of that sure wisdom which comes only to the
young when they discover just why they have been
born into the world.</p>
<p>How many joys there were for those attuned to receive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
them! Her fingers laced with Bob&#8217;s, and from the
contact a warm, ecstatic glow flooded both their bodies.
She looked at his clean brown face, with its line of
golden down above where the razor had traveled, with
its tousled, reddish hair falling into the smiling eyes, and
a queer little lump surged into the girl&#8217;s throat. Her
husband! This boy was the mate heaven had sent her
to repay for years of unhappiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;My wife!&#8221; It was all still so new and unbelievable
that Bob&#8217;s voice shook a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sorry?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>Her shy smile teased. She did not ask because she
needed information, but because she could not hear too
often the answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know whether I am. Oh, June girl, I didn&#8217;t
know it would be like this,&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor I, Bob.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their lithe bodies leaned from the saddles. They held
each other close while their lips met.</p>
<p>They were on their way to Pete Tolliver&#8217;s to tell him
the great news. Soon now the old cabin and its outbuildings
would break into view. They had only to
climb Twelve-Mile Hill.</p>
<p>Out of a draw to the right a horse moved. Through
the brush something dragged behind it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked June.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know. Looks kinda queer. It&#8217;s got some
sort of harness on.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode to the draw. June gave a small cry of distress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Bob, it&#8217;s a man.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></p>
<p>He dismounted. The horse with the dragging load
backed away, but it was too tired to show much energy.
Bob moved forward, soothing the animal with gentle
sounds. He went slowly, with no sudden gestures. Presently
he was patting the neck of the horse. With his
hunting-knife he cut the rawhide thongs that served as a
harness.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a Ute pony,&#8221; he said, after he had looked it over
carefully. He knew this because the Indians earmarked
their mounts.</p>
<p>June was still in the saddle. Some instinct warned her
not to look too closely at the load behind that was so
horribly twisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better go back to the road, June,&#8221; her husband
advised. &#8220;It&#8217;s too late to do anything for this poor
fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did as he said, without another look at the broken
body.</p>
<p>When she had gone, Bob went close and turned over
the huddled figure. Torn though it was, he recognized
the face of Jake Houck. To construct the main features
of the tragedy was not difficult.</p>
<p>While escaping from Bear Cat after the fiasco of the
bank robbery, Houck must have stumbled somehow
into the hands of the Ute band still at large. They had
passed judgment on him and executed it. No doubt the
wretched man had been tied at the heels of a horse
which had been lashed into a frenzied gallop by the Indians
in its rear. He had been dragged or kicked to
death by the frightened horse.</p>
<p>As Bob looked down into that still, disfigured face,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
there came to him vividly a sense of the weakness and
frailty of human nature. Not long since this bit of lifeless
clay had straddled his world like a Colossus. To the
young cowpuncher he had been a superman, terrible in
his power and capacity to do harm. Now all that vanity
and egoism had vanished, blown away as though it had
never been.</p>
<p>Where was Jake Houck? What had become of him?
The shell that had been his was here. But where was the
roaring bully that had shaken his fist blasphemously at
God and man?</p>
<p>It came to him, with a queer tug at the heartstrings,
that Houck had once been a dimpled baby in a mother&#8217;s
arms, a chirruping little fat-legged fellow who tottered
across the floor to her with outstretched fingers. Had
that innocent child disappeared forever? Or in that
other world to which Jake had so violently gone would
he meet again the better self his evil life had smothered?</p>
<p>Bob loosened the bandanna from his throat and with
it covered the face of the outlaw. He straightened the
body and folded the hands across the breast. It was
not in his power to obliterate from the face the look
of ghastly, rigid terror stamped on it during the last
terrible moments.</p>
<p>The young husband went back to his waiting wife.
He stood by her stirrup while she looked down at him,
white-faced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was it?&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jake Houck,&#8221; he told her gravely. &#8220;The Utes did it&mdash;because
he killed Black Arrow, I reckon.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></p>
<p>She shuddered. A cloud had come over the beautiful
world.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go on now,&#8221; he said gently. &#8220;I&#8217;ll come back
later with your father.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode in silence up the long hill. At the top of it
he drew rein and smiled at his bride.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not let that spoil the day, will you, June? He
had it coming, you know. Houck had gone bad. If it
hadn&#8217;t been the Utes, it would have been the law a little
later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but&mdash;&#8221; She tried to answer his smile, not very
successfully. &#8220;It&#8217;s rather&mdash;awful, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded. &#8220;Let&#8217;s walk over to the cabin, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>She swung down, into his arms. There she found
comfort that dissipated the cloud from her mind. When
she ran into the house to throw her arms around Pete
Tolliver&#8217;s neck, she was again radiant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess! Guess what!&#8221; she ordered her father.</p>
<p>Pete looked at his daughter and at the bashful, smiling
boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I done guessed, honeybug,&#8221; he answered,
stroking her rebellious hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re to come and live with us. Isn&#8217;t he, Bob?&#8221;</p>
<p>The young husband nodded sheepishly. He felt that
it was a brutal thing to take a daughter from her father.
It had not occurred to him before, but old Pete would
feel rather out of it now.</p>
<p>Tolliver looked at Bob over the shoulder of his daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You be good to her or I&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221; His voice broke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure will,&#8221; the husband promised.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></p>
<p>June laughed. &#8220;He&#8217;s the one ought to worry, Dad.
I&#8217;m the flyaway on this team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob looked at her, gifts in his eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;m worryin&#8217; a
heap,&#8221; he said, smiling.</p>
